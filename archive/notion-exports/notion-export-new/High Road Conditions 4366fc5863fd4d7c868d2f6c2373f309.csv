01,10/01/2023,"Fair, Poor",Heavy,Good,Sound,Good,"Chunk missing from aft edge of rudder. Inflatable under bow blocking some access to hull. This was largely a “shearing” cleaning, wherein I removed the bulk of the hard growth but left a layer of algae to removed on the next service."
02,12/01/2023,"Fair, Poor","Heavy, Moderate",Good,Sound,Good,"A much more time-intensive cleaning. 80% of the time is often required to get the last 20% clean. Going forward, I’m hoping cleanings will be faster now that we’ve gotten down to mostly clean paint again."

05,06/13/2024,Poor,Heavy,Fair,Sound,Good,"Paint biocide properties have failed. Hull will be sheared instead of scrubbed until repainting. This will remove protruding growth but prevent further paint from being scrubbed away. Paint will retain a “dirty” appearance after cleaning. "
