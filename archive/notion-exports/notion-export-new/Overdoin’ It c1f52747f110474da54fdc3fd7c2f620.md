The paint is in poor condition and worn through in several areas.

Heavy three-dimensional and shelled-animal growth were found covering entire wetted surface area.

A thorough scrapping was performed over nearly two hours to remove the above mentioned growth. A thin layer of slime now remains. 

Propellers and rudders appeared degraded but will require de-scaling to properly evaluate condition. 

Recommendations: A haul-out is recommended to fully assess and, if needed, repair rudders and propellers, as well as replace anti-fouling paint. In lieu of a haul-out, a detailed hull cleaning that includes wire-wheeling the propellers and rudders and a full evaluation of the anode status’ is recommended.
