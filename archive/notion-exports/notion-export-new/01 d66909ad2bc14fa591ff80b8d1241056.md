Anodes: Fair
Duration: 60
Notes: Shaft loose in cutlass bearing as noted. Some blisters observed on rudder (visible in video). Widespread embedded black algae indicates anti-fouling properties are failing. Paint is worn through in several areas, including bottom of keel and waterline. Appears to be ablative.
