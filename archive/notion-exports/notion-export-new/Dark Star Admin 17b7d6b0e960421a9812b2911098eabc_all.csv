Diver’s dream on transom in good condition.
Attempted to clear forward thru-hulls, but the seacocks were closed.
Trim tabs anode bolt holes should be drilled out to accept the larger bolts now standard on the 3.25”+ anodes. I can do that on the next service. In the meantime, I have installed 2.5” trim tab anodes. ",,Good,,1259,1405
