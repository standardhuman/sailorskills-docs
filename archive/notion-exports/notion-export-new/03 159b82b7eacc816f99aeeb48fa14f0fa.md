Anodes: Poor
Date: 12/09/2023
Growth: Heavy, Minimal
Notes: All anodes need replacing. I will source the correct anodes and return. The paint around the forward starboard thru-hull  drains is deteriorating rapidly, possibly due to material being discharged. Try to avoid discharging harsh liquids to preserve the paint. 
Paint: Excellent, Poor
Prop: Good
Thru-hulls: Sound
