Anodes: Excellent
Date: 01/02/2024
Growth: Heavy, Moderate
Notes: Light barnacle growth at waterline. Spots of heavy growth underside of keel and various other spots where paint is missing. There is “paint burn” / “sickness” above the forward starboard thru-hull drain. I advise being mindful of corrosive material being discharged here. Bleach, for instance, will cause this. Also, there is widespread embedded black algae  throughout the paint, indicative of the anti-fouling properties diminishing. Paint wear remains good, save for the areas of missing paint. 
Paint: Fair, Good, Missing
Prop: Polished
Thru-hulls: Sound
