Anodes: Fair, Good
Date: 04/22/2025
Growth: Heavy
Notes: Barnacles and mussel growth occurring over much of running gear. This is common when a boat is moored in shallow water, as is Mary Jayden. Most of the anodes will need to be replaced on the next service in six months, except for the hull anodes. Starboard shaft, trim tab, and rudder anodes are deteriorating faster than those on the port side.
Paint: Good
Prop: Good
Thru-hulls: Sound
