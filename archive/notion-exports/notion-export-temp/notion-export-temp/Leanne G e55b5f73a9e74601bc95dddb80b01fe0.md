**NOTE: The lower units of both outdrives are showing heavy galvanic deterioration. The skegs are missing chunks along the edges with widespread deep pitting over the surfaces. I recommend hauling out as soon as possible to repair or replace necessary components and install anodes where possible.** 

The bottom paint appeared to be in excellent condition with little to no growth overall.

Propellers appeared to be in excellent condition.

Wiped down the trim tabs and struts. 

Thru-hulls and depth transducer appeared sound.
