# 01

Anodes: Good
Date: 10/01/2023
Growth: Heavy
Notes: Chunk missing from aft edge of rudder. Inflatable under bow blocking some access to hull. This was largely a “shearing” cleaning, wherein I removed the bulk of the hard growth but left a layer of algae to removed on the next service.
Paint: Fair, Poor
Prop: Good
Thru-hulls: Sound
