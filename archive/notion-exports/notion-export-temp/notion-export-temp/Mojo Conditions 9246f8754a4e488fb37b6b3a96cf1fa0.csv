02,02/04/2023,No,Fair,"Minimal, Moderate",Fair,Sound,Good,"Noticed what appears to be some larger blisters on the starboard side of the keel. The knot meter paddle wheel was found to be spinning freely. If it did not perform well during the race this weekend, I think we can confirm it's not due to growth. The paint is in fair condition. To leave the bottom with a uniformly ""clean"" appearance would require heavy scrubbing to bring the surrounding paint down enough to the level of the low spots of the texture. Once the three-dimensional growth becomes difficult to remove, I will let you know it's definitely time for a new bottom. Of course, if you want a very smooth finish earlier, painting sooner than that will be required. One shaft anode may need replacing on next service. Polished up the prop."
