Notes: Inspected the bolts attaching the trim actuators to the trim tabs. While one is loose on the starboard side and can be removed by hand, there is not actually any space to install a nut on the backside, and none of the other 3 fasteners (2 on each tab) have a nut, either. What they do appear to have, is a type of hardened plastic coating on the threads which seems to make the bolt thick enough to not back out. This coating seems to have broken off on the starboard-most bolt. This area is very hard to access from the water. However, given that the bolt seems to not be inclined to back out during all of your use of the boat, I think it’s something we can probably monitor and repair properly on the next haul-out.
