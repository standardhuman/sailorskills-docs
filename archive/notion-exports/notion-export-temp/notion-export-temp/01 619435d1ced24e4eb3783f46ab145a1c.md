Notes: Replaced 2x 1 3/8” streamlined shaft anodes. Other two shaft anodes and stern plates in good condition. Potential issued with rudders with paint eroding in pattern similar to electrolysis. Recommend contacting manufacturer and sharing video. Starboard trim tab missing nuts where actuator connects to tab. I’ll bring an array of fasteners next time but if you procure the correct sizes that would be helpful. Arranged the remaining anodes on the end of the dock, will replace in dockbox this week (I work from the water and have to remove a signifacnt amount of gear to come onto the dock).
