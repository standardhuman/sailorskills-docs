01,Good,05/11/2023,"Heavy, Moderate",,"From the diver: The paint was in fair to poor condition. There were areas of thinning paint on the keel, waterline and rudder. The keel is resting in the mud during low tide, causing increased wear in this area and an accumulation of shelled growth. Neither the Max prop nor the plate zincs needed to be changed. Heavy fouling was cleared from the transducer. I'd recommend a cleaning every 2 months.","Fair, Poor",Good,Sound
