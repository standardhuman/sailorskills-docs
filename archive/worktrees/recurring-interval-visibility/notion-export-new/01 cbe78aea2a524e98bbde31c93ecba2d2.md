Notes: A plastic bag was found entangled with the propeller and removed. A light slime was found covering all wetted-surface areas; I removed 75% of it, including the waterline, leading edge of keel, and entire propeller and rudder areas. A complete cleaning will be performed next month. Many small barnacles were observed on the propeller. It was not apparent how much Propspeed or similar protective coating remains on the propeller surface.
