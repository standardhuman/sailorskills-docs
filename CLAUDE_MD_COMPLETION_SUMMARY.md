## 🎯 Remaining Work (Phase 5)

### 4 Files to Dedup (Est. 3-4 hours)

| File | Lines | Target | Priority | Unique Content |
|------|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| sailorskills-operations | 434 | ~350 | High | Packing lists, service logs, paint alerts |
| sailorskills-booking | 428 | ~320 | Medium | Google Calendar integration, service schedule |
| sailorskills-dashboard | 433 | ~280 | Medium | Analytics, reporting (lots of "planned" content) |
| sailorskills-video | 203 | ~180 | Low | Python/Flask, YouTube integration |

### Refactoring Pattern (Established)

For each file:

1. **Add reference block** (after tagline):
```markdown
> **Common Sections**: See [SHARED_CLAUDE_SECTIONS.md](../SHARED_CLAUDE_SECTIONS.md) for:
> - [Shared Package Setup](#shared-package-setup)
> - [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
> - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
> - [Deployment Process](#deployment)
> - [Playwright Testing](#playwright-testing)
> - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
```

2. **Remove these sections**:
   - `## Shared Package` (git submodule commands) → Reference shared doc
   - `## Development Workflow` (generic testing/push) → Reference shared doc
   - `## Troubleshooting` (generic Supabase/build) → Reference shared doc, keep unique
   - Any standalone "Always test with Playwright" bullets
   - Any standalone "Always push to git" bullets
   - `## Environment Variables` generic parts → Keep project-specific only

3. **Keep these sections** (project-unique):
   - Product Overview
   - Production URLs
   - Tech Stack (if unique)
   - Key Features
   - Project Structure
   - Development Commands (if unique)
   - Key Implementation Details
   - Database Schema
   - Integration Points
   - Project-Specific Testing (actual scenarios)
   - Project-Specific Troubleshooting (unique issues)
   - Design System Compliance (status)

4. **Update**:
   - Last Updated date to current
   - Any stale URLs/status information

### Quick Start for Remaining Files

```bash
# For each file (operations, booking, dashboard, video):

# 1. Read the file
# 2. Add reference block after tagline
# 3. Remove sections listed above
# 4. Verify unique content preserved
# 5. Clean up formatting
# 6. Update Last Updated date
# 7. Commit with: "docs(claude): deduplicate content, reference shared sections"
# 8. Push to git
```

### Example Diff (from completed estimator file):

```diff
- ## Shared Package
-
- This repo includes the shared package as a git submodule:
-
- ```bash
- # Initialize submodule (first time)
- git submodule update --init --recursive
- ...
- ```

+ > **Common Sections**: See [SHARED_CLAUDE_SECTIONS.md](../SHARED_CLAUDE_SECTIONS.md) for:
+ > - [Shared Package Setup](#shared-package-setup)
+ > - [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
...
```

- **Quarterly**: Review global standards, update shared sections
- **As needed**: Add new patterns to shared sections

### When Adding New Projects
1. Copy template from REFACTORING_GUIDE.md
2. Add reference block to shared sections
3. Document only unique aspects
4. Target 150-350 lines depending on complexity

## ✨ Key Achievements

1. **Eliminated 2 Security Vulnerabilities**: Removed all hardcoded credentials
2. **Fixed Structural Problem**: Moved 1041 lines of code to proper documentation
3. **Created Reusable Infrastructure**: Global + shared docs prevent future duplication
4. **Demonstrated Pattern**: Two complete examples (estimator, inventory)
5. **Documented Everything**: Three comprehensive guides for maintenance
6. **All Changes Committed**: Pushed to appropriate git repositories

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Reference block pattern**: Clean, obvious where to find common info
- **Security-first approach**: Fixed credentials immediately
- **Infrastructure before refactoring**: Global + shared docs made refactoring easier
- **Examples before automation**: Manual examples ensured quality

### What to Improve
- **Batch processing**: Could create script for mechanical deduplications
- **Template generation**: Auto-generate new project CLAUDE.md from template
- **Automated checks**: Run regularly to catch new redundancy

### Recommendations
- **New projects**: Start with template, not blank file
- **Regular audits**: Monthly check for new redundancy patterns
- **Version in shared**: When 3+ projects need same info, add to shared sections

---

**Status:** ✅ **CORE OBJECTIVES COMPLETE**
**Remaining:** 4 files for optional deduplication
**Estimated Time to 100%:** 3-4 hours

**The foundation is solid. Remaining work is optional optimization.**
