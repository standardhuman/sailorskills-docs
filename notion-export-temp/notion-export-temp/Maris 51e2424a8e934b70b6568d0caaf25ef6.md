Time: **10:26 - 10:50 (~23 minutes)**

The paint remains in fair condition. Widespread embedded black algae indicate the biocidal properties are failing.

Thru-hulls and prop appeared sound.

Both anodes are in fair condition.

**Issues:** I noticed what appears to be some larger blisters on the starboard side of the keel. They are in the 4th video of the playlist, though they may not show easily.

The paint is in fair condition. The slime comes off easily but the algae require scrubbing with a medium pad or brush, and much algae will remain in the texture of the paint even after scrubbing. This leaves the bottom smooth but with a dirty" look in many places. To leave the bottom with a uniformly "clean" appearance would require heavy scrubbing to bring the surrounding paint down enough to the level of the low spots of the texture. I hope that makes sense. Basically, I would need to remove a lot of paint. 

Once the three-dimensional growth becomes difficult to remove, I will let you know it's definitely time for a new bottom. Of course, if you want a very smooth finish earlier, painting sooner than that will be required.

On this cleaning, the knot meter paddle wheel was found to be spinning freely. I then used a very small bottle brush to remove every bit of growth from every surface in and around the wheel. If it did not perform well during the race this weekend, I think we can confirm it's not due to growth.

The anodes are in fair condition. One shaft anode may need replacing on next service.

I also polished up the prop.
