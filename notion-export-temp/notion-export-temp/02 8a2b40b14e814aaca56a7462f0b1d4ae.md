# 02

Anodes: Good
Date: 12/01/2023
Growth: Heavy, Moderate
Notes: A much more time-intensive cleaning. 80% of the time is often required to get the last 20% clean. Going forward, I’m hoping cleanings will be faster now that we’ve gotten down to mostly clean paint again.
Paint: Fair, Poor
Prop: Good
Thru-hulls: Sound
