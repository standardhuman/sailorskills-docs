Anodes: Replaced
Date: 12/17/2023
Duration: 66
Notes: Replaced: 
4 x 1” streamlined shaft anodes on swim platform struts ($13),
4 x 1-1/2” streamlined shaft anodes on prop shafts ($23)
2 x 2.5” trim tab anodes on trim tabs ($10). 
Diver’s dream on transom in good condition.
Attempted to clear forward thru-hulls, but the seacocks were closed.
Trim tabs anode bolt holes should be drilled out to accept the larger bolts now standard on the 3.25”+ anodes. I can do that on the next service. In the meantime, I have installed 2.5” trim tab anodes.
