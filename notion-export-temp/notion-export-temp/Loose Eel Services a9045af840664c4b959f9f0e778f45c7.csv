01,3,12/04/2023,No,944,Excellent,Minimal,"Good, Replaced",Sound,Polished,"Replaced 2x 1 3/8” streamlined shaft anodes. Other two shaft anodes and stern plates in good condition. Potential issued with rudders with paint eroding in pattern similar to electrolysis. Recommend contacting manufacturer and sharing video. Starboard trim tab missing nuts where actuator connects to tab. I’ll bring an array of fasteners next time but if you procure the correct sizes that would be helpful. Arranged the remaining anodes on the end of the dock, will replace in dockbox this week (I work from the water and have to remove a signifacnt amount of gear to come onto the dock).

02,2,01/02/2024,Yes,1149,Not Evaluated,Not Evaluated,Not Evaluated,Not Evaluated,Good,"Inspected the bolts attaching the trim actuators to the trim tabs. While one is loose on the starboard side and can be removed by hand, there is not actually any space to install a nut on the backside, and none of the other 3 fasteners (2 on each tab) have a nut, either. What they do appear to have, is a type of hardened plastic coating on the threads which seems to make the bolt thick enough to not back out. This coating seems to have broken off on the starboard-most bolt. This area is very hard to access from the water. However, given that the bolt seems to not be inclined to back out during all of your use of the boat, I think it’s something we can probably monitor and repair properly on the next haul-out.",1157,8,$99.00,8,$16.00,,,$16.00,$8.00
