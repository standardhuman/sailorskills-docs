Growth: Heavy
Notes: Aft waterline remains submerged causing heavy growth on the gelcoat above the bottom paint. Recommend redistributing weight aboard, or raising waterline on the next haul-out. Paint is no longer effective. Missing paint is widespread, along with small blisters, most notable on the rudder.
