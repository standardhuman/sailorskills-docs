# 08

Anodes: Good
Date: 09/25/2025
Growth: Minimal, Moderate
Notes: Most of the paint on starboard exhibits all of the properties of old paint, except in a few specific areas where you can see the roller strokes. In those spots, the paint is evidently new and effectively repelling growth, as it is for the entire port side. The difference is stark and delineated exactly along the keel edge between port and starboard. 
Paint: Excellent, Poor
Prop: Good
Thru-hulls: Sound
