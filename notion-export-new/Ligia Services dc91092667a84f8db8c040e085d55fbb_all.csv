1,None,06/13/2023,34,Severe,"Rudder checked for play, none found. Gap between rudder and hull is minimal and normal.  Two of three thru-hulls on the port, forward side were unclear in their status. Middle one appeared to have some kind of blockage just inside, may have been the closed valve but was not smooth. Aft-most of the three appeared to have some kind of soft covering on it, which was painted with bottom paint. It felt like I could have pierced it without too much effort. Please see the video for more details. ","Fair, Poor",None,Possible Issue,1546,1620
