---

### Task 1.4: Database Schema Audit & Validation üü† HIGH
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Owner:** Engineering Team
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Dependencies:** Database access tools

**Problem:**
- Schema validation shows missing columns/tables:
  - `service_logs.technician` (missing)

1. Run schema validation across all services:
   ```bash
   node sailorskills-portal/scripts/test-helpers/example-check-schema.mjs
   ```
2. Document all discrepancies found
3. Determine which are code bugs vs. schema gaps:
   - Check service code to see if columns are actually used
   - Query database to confirm missing elements
4. Create migration plan for genuine schema gaps
5. Update service code for false expectations
6. Run migrations using `run-migration.mjs`
7. Re-run validation to confirm success

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Schema matches all service expectations
- ‚úÖ No validation errors
- ‚úÖ Migrations documented in MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md

## PHASE 2: SHARED PACKAGE ADOPTION ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Establish consistent design system and eliminate code duplication
**Duration:** Week 2 (5-7 days)
**Effort:** 15-20 hours
**Priority:** üü† HIGH
**Status:** 1/4 tasks complete (25%)
**Started:** 2025-10-27

### Task 2.1: Add Shared Submodule to Missing Services ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Affected Services:** billing, dashboard, inventory, operations, video (5 services)
**Effort:** 3-4 hours (Actual: 2 hours)
**Completed:** 2025-10-27

**Problem:**
- Only 50% of services have shared submodule (booking, estimator, portal, site)
- Missing from: billing, dashboard, inventory, operations, video
- Causes design inconsistency, code duplication, breaking change risks

**Steps:**
1. For each service missing shared submodule:
   ```bash
   cd sailorskills-[service]
   git submodule add https://github.com/standardhuman/sailorskills-shared.git shared
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Update each service's HTML to import:
   - `/shared/src/ui/design-tokens.css`
   - `/shared/src/ui/styles.css`
   - Montserrat font (Google Fonts)
3. Test build for each service: `npm run build`
4. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`
5. Smoke test in production

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ All 9 services have shared submodule (was 4/9, now 9/9)
- ‚úÖ All builds succeed (Operations, Billing tested)
- ‚è≥ No visual regressions in production (awaiting verification)

**Commits:**
- Operations: a0d685c
- Dashboard: 0f74001
- Inventory: 0f08c1b
- Billing: d794c55
- Video: No changes needed (no CDN imports)

**Rationale Confirmed:**
Git submodules prevent breaking change risks by allowing controlled rollout of shared package updates per service, versus CDN approach where all services update instantly.
