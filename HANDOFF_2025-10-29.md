## üöÄ Quick Start for Next Session

### Option 1: Subagent-Driven Development (Recommended)

Execute tasks one at a time with code review between each:

```bash
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-operations
```

Then say to Claude:
```
I'm ready to implement the Pending Orders Queue using subagent-driven development.
Use the plan at: docs/plans/2025-10-29-pending-orders-implementation.md
```

Claude will:
1. Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` skill
2. Launch subagent for Task 1
3. Review code after completion
4. Launch subagent for Task 2
5. Continue through all 9 tasks

### Option 2: Parallel Session Execution

Open new Claude Code session and say:
```
Execute the pending orders implementation plan at:
docs/plans/2025-10-29-pending-orders-implementation.md

Use superpowers:executing-plans skill for batch execution.
```

## üìä Project Status

### Overall Progress: 11/16 tasks (69%)
- **Phase 1:** ‚úÖ Complete (Security & Compliance)
- **Phase 2:** ‚úÖ Complete (Shared Package)
- **Phase 3:** ‚úÖ Substantially Complete (Testing & Architecture)
- **Phase 4:** üü° In Progress (Task 4.1 ready for implementation)

### Phase 4 Remaining Tasks
- **Task 4.1:** üü° Design complete ‚Üí Implementation ready (8-12 hours)
- **Task 4.2:** Import Notion Service Log Data (2-3 hours)
- **Task 4.3:** Standardize Authentication (6-8 hours)
- **Task 4.4:** Add MFA for Production (2-3 hours)

---

## üîë Key Design Decisions

### Requirements Captured
1. **UI Placement:** Dedicated "Orders" section in main navigation (most visible)
2. **Scheduling:** Auto-suggest next available date based on service interval, allow override
3. **Declines:** Require reason, offer optional customer email notification
4. **Organization:** Sort oldest-first, filter by service type, highlight aged orders (>3 days)
5. **No Schema Changes:** Uses existing `service_orders` table

### User Workflow
```
Order created in Estimator (status='pending')
        ‚Üì
Appears in Operations Orders view
        ‚Üì
Admin reviews order
        ‚Üì
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
Confirm   Decline   Defer
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
status=    status=
confirmed  cancelled
scheduled_ notes=reason
date set   email sent
```

### Technical Approach
- **No Database Changes:** Works with current schema
- **Auto-Scheduling:** Calculates date from service interval + last service date
- **Email Placeholder:** Logs to console, ready for Resend integration
- **Design System:** Uses sharp corners, Montserrat font, shared CSS variables
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design tested

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Orders view loads with pending orders
- [ ] Filter tabs work for each service type
- [ ] Order cards show age warnings (>3 days)
- [ ] Confirm modal opens with suggested date
- [ ] Date picker allows override
- [ ] Confirm updates database (status='confirmed', scheduled_date set)
- [ ] Decline modal captures reason
- [ ] Email preview updates with reason text
- [ ] Decline updates database (status='cancelled', notes set)
- [ ] Order count badge updates
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

### Database Test Orders
```sql
-- Create test orders
INSERT INTO service_orders (order_number, customer_id, boat_id, service_type, service_interval, estimated_amount, status, created_at)
VALUES
  ('TEST-001', 'uuid', 'uuid', 'Cleaning & Anodes', '1-month', 150.00, 'pending', NOW()),
  ('TEST-002', 'uuid', 'uuid', 'Inspection', '2-month', 75.00, 'pending', NOW() - INTERVAL '5 days');
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Notes

### Integration Tests (Phase 3)
- 5 Portal UI tests failing due to missing Supabase Auth accounts
- Database integration tests 94% passing (primary goal achieved)
- Can enhance Portal tests later when UI testing becomes priority

### Email Integration
- Currently placeholder (logs to console)
- Ready for Resend integration
- Guide included in implementation plan
- Does not block feature completion

### Operations Service Structure
- Each service is its own git repo
- `sailorskills-operations` has separate remote from `sailorskills-repos`
- Work directly in operations repo, don't use worktrees

---

## üé¨ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session):
1. ‚úÖ **Implement Pending Orders Queue** (8-12 hours)
   - Use subagent-driven development
   - Follow 9-task implementation plan
   - Test thoroughly before merging

### After Task 4.1 Complete:
2. **Task 4.2:** Import Notion Service Log Data (2-3 hours)
   - Historical data migration
   - Already have migration scripts

3. **Task 4.3:** Standardize Authentication (6-8 hours)
   - Would also fix Portal integration test issues
   - Consistent auth across all services

4. **Task 4.4:** Add MFA for Production (2-3 hours)
   - Security enhancement
   - Low effort, high value

---

## üí° Tips for Next Session

### Working Efficiently
- Implementation plan has complete code examples
- Follow TDD workflow: test ‚Üí fail ‚Üí implement ‚Üí pass ‚Üí commit
- Each task takes 30 min - 1.5 hours
- Commit after each task completion

### Common Gotchas
- Order age calculation needs EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...) in SQL
- Modal styling uses sharp corners (no border-radius)
- Badge count should update after confirm/decline
- Email preview needs real-time updates as reason typed

### Success Criteria
- All 9 tasks complete
- Orders view functional
- Confirm/decline workflows tested
- Database updates verified
- Documentation complete
- Ready for PR and code review
