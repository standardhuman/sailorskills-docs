# Task 2.2: Migrate to Shared Utilities - Implementation Plan

**Created:** 2025-10-27
**Updated:** 2025-10-27 (Post Batch 1 Discovery)
**Status:** ⏸️ IN PROGRESS - Batch 1 paused, Option D identified
**Prerequisite:** ✅ Task 2.1 Complete & Verified
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours (4 services, ~1.5-2 hours each)

---

## 🔄 UPDATE: Option D Approach (2025-10-27)

**Discovery:** During Batch 1 (Dashboard), discovered shared package has `initSupabaseAuth()` which is the correct auth system to use (not `SimpleAuth`).

**Decision:** Use **Option D** - Vite build + initSupabaseAuth + CDN Supabase library

**See:** `TASK_2.2_BATCH1_SESSION_NOTES.md` for detailed findings

**Remaining:**
- Batch 1: 30-45 min (implement Option D in Dashboard)
- Batch 2-4: 4-5 hours (apply same approach to other services)

---

## Current State

✅ **Task 2.1 Complete:**
- All 9 services have `/shared/` submodule
- All services use local `/shared/src/...` imports for design tokens & navigation
- Production verified (4/4 services passing)

❌ **Task 2.2 Problem:**
- Services have duplicated auth/supabase/stripe code locally
- Same functionality implemented multiple times
- Maintenance burden (changes need to be made in 4+ places)

---

## Audit Results Summary

### Duplicated Code Found

**Dashboard** (`sailorskills-dashboard/`):
- `js/supabase-auth.js` (209 lines) - Full auth with modal, session management

**Inventory** (`sailorskills-inventory/`):
- `supabase-auth.js` (class-based auth)
- `supabase-inventory-auth.js` (inventory-specific)

**Operations** (`sailorskills-operations/`):
- `src/auth/init-supabase-auth.js`
- `src/auth/admin-auth.js`
- `src/lib/supabase.js` (client initialization)

**Billing** (`sailorskills-billing/`):
- `src/auth/init-supabase-auth.js`
- `src/auth/supabase-auth.js`
- `src/admin/inline-scripts/supabase-init.js`
- Various Stripe helper scripts (in `/scripts/`)

### What Shared Package Already Has

✅ **Available in `/shared/src/`:**
- `SimpleAuth` - Authentication with modal UI
- `createSupabaseClient()` - Configured Supabase client
- `initStripe()`, `createCardElement()` - Stripe helpers
- `createModal()`, `showToast()` - UI components

---

## Goal

Replace all duplicated utility code with shared package imports, removing local copies.

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ Zero duplicated auth code in services
2. ✅ Zero duplicated Supabase client initialization
3. ✅ Zero duplicated Stripe helpers (Billing only)
4. ✅ All services use imports from `/shared/src/index.js`
5. ✅ All authentication flows work correctly
6. ✅ All tests passing

---

## Migration Strategy

**Approach:** Sequential service-by-service (LOW RISK)

**Rationale:**
- Lower risk (one service at a time)
- Easy to test and rollback
- Can refine approach after each service
- Auth is critical - better to go slow and verify

**Execution Order:**
1. Dashboard (simplest, static files)
2. Inventory (static files, similar to dashboard)
3. Operations (Vite build, more complex)
4. Billing (Vite build, most complex with Stripe)

---

## Implementation Steps (Per Service)

### Step 1: Identify Local Auth Files

**For each service:**
```bash
find [service] -name "*auth*.js" -o -name "*supabase*.js" \
  ! -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  ! -path "*/shared/*" \
  ! -path "*/dist/*"
```

Document what each file does and whether it's used.

---

### Step 2: Update Imports to Use Shared Package

**BEFORE (local auth):**
```javascript
// Local file: js/supabase-auth.js
// 200+ lines of custom code
```

**AFTER (shared package):**
```javascript
// Import from shared
import { SimpleAuth, createSupabaseClient } from '/shared/src/index.js';

// Initialize
const supabase = createSupabaseClient();
const auth = new SimpleAuth({
  supabase,
  serviceName: 'Dashboard Admin',
  requiredAuth: true
});

// Check auth on page load
await auth.checkAuth();
```

---

### Step 3: Remove Local Files

**Delete duplicated code:**
```bash
# After verifying shared imports work
rm js/supabase-auth.js
git add js/supabase-auth.js
git commit -m "Remove duplicated auth (now using shared package)"
```

⚠️ **Important:** Only delete after confirming shared version works!

---

### Step 4: Test Locally

**For static services (Dashboard, Inventory):**
```bash
# Use local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Test in browser:
# 1. Auth modal appears
# 2. Login with standardhuman@gmail.com / KLRss!650
# 3. Content loads after auth
# 4. No console errors
# 5. Logout works
```

**For Vite services (Operations, Billing):**
```bash
npm run dev

# Test same flow as above
```

---

### Step 5: Deploy & Verify Production

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "[PHASE2-2.2] Migrate [service] to shared utilities

- Remove local auth files
- Import SimpleAuth from shared package
- Import createSupabaseClient from shared package
- All auth flows tested and working

1. Update Dashboard HTML files to import from shared
2. Remove `js/supabase-auth.js`
3. Test locally (http.server)
4. Deploy to production
5. Verify in production

**Stop Point:** Report results before proceeding to Batch 2

---

### Batch 2: Inventory
**Tasks:**
1. Update Inventory HTML files
2. Remove both auth files
3. Test locally
4. Deploy
5. Verify

**Stop Point:** Report results before proceeding to Batch 3

---

### Batch 3: Operations

2. Remove auth files
3. Remove `src/lib/supabase.js`
4. Test with `npm run dev`
5. Deploy
6. Verify

**Stop Point:** Report results before proceeding to Batch 4

---

### Batch 4: Billing

1. Update `src/main.js` imports
2. Remove auth files
3. Audit Stripe helpers
4. Test payment flows
5. Deploy
6. Verify

**Stop Point:** Final report

---

## Verification Requirements

**After Each Service:**

1. ✅ Local testing passes all checks
2. ✅ Production deployment succeeds
3. ✅ Auth flow works in production
4. ✅ Core features work (queries, forms)
5. ✅ No console errors
6. ✅ Playwright tests pass (if applicable)

**After All Services:**

1. ✅ Run cross-service smoke test
2. ✅ Verify no duplicated code remains
3. ✅ All services using shared package
4. ✅ Documentation updated

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan

If any service breaks:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```

Immediate rollback with single command.

### Testing Strategy

- Test locally BEFORE deploying
- Use Playwright MCP for automated testing
- Verify in production immediately after deploy
- Have test credentials ready

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Import path not resolving
**Solution:** Check Vercel config, ensure `/shared/` is accessible

**Issue:** Auth modal not appearing
**Solution:** Check browser console, verify SimpleAuth import

**Issue:** Supabase client not initializing
**Solution:** Verify environment variables in Vercel

---

## Conservative Approach (If Needed)

If full migration too risky:

**Phase 2.2a:** Import path migration only
- Keep local auth files
- Just import Supabase client from shared
- Verify everything still works

**Phase 2.2b:** Auth replacement (later)
- Once confident in shared package
- Replace auth implementations one by one
- Separate from Supabase client migration

**Recommended:** Start with full migration (dashboard pilot), but have conservative fallback ready.

---

## Success Metrics

**Task 2.2 Complete When:**

1. ✅ All 4 services migrated to shared utilities
2. ✅ Zero duplicated auth/supabase code remains
3. ✅ All authentication flows working
4. ✅ All core features working
5. ✅ All services deployed to production
6. ✅ All production verification passing
7. ✅ No console errors in any service
8. ✅ Documentation updated

---

## Next Steps After Task 2.2

- **Task 2.3:** Implement Shared Navigation System (4-6 hours)
- **Task 2.4:** Design Token Audit (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 2 Complete:** Move to Phase 3 (Testing & Architecture)
