# Orphaned Service Logs Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Issue**: Operations showing "no service history" for most boats
**Root Cause**: 179 service logs had NULL boat_id values from Notion migration

## Results

### Phase 1: Auto-fix Single-Boat Customers ✅
- **Updated**: 116 service logs
- **Method**: Automatically linked logs to boats via customer_id matching
- **Customers affected**: 7 customers with single boats

### Phase 2: Multi-Boat Customers ⏭️
- **Skipped**: 72 logs (per user request)
- **Sharon Greenhagen**: 48 logs, 3 boats (Deux Coeurs, Heartstring, Second Wind)
- **Fred Cook**: 24 logs, 2 boats (SEQUOIA, Sequoia - likely duplicates)
- **Action needed**: Manual review to determine which boat each log belongs to

### Phase 3: Stripe Customer IDs ⏭️
- **Skipped**: 9 logs (test data, no matching customers)
- **Dates**: Oct 9-14, 2025
- **Note**: These are likely Playwright test runs

## Final Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Total service logs | 1,439 | 1,439 | - |
| Logs with boat_id | 1,260 | 1,376 | +116 ✅ |
| Orphaned logs | 179 | 63 | -116 ✅ |
| Boats with history | 135 | 136 | +1 |

## Remaining Work

1. **Sharon Greenhagen's logs (48)**: Review service log details/notes to determine which of her 3 boats each service belongs to
2. **Fred Cook's boat duplicates**: Merge "SEQUOIA" and "Sequoia" boats (same customer, created 1 second apart)
3. **Test data cleanup**: Remove or properly link the 9 Stripe customer ID test logs

## Migration Script

See `fix_orphaned_service_logs.sql` for the complete migration script with all phases.

## Verification

Operations should now show service history for 136 boats (up from 135). The remaining 63 orphaned logs require manual review or are test data.
