## Q1 2026

### Mobile-First Platform Strategy
- [ ] **Complete Video Native Mobile App & Begin Billing Mobile Conversion**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** Q2 2026 Operations Native Mobile App
  - **Rationale:** Field operations require native mobile apps for reliability, session persistence, and background processing. Current web apps have critical limitations: browser sessions reload during long dives (losing Billing form state), and video uploads cannot run reliably in background. Native apps provide persistent sessions, background upload/download capabilities, offline-first architecture, and better battery/network management. Video mobile app (React Native/Expo) is 87% complete (Phases 1-7 done), needs final testing and deployment. Billing has immediate need for session persistence during dives.
  - **Current State - Video Mobile (sailorskills-video/BOATY-Mobile):**
    - **Status:** 87.5% complete (7 of 8 phases done)
    - **Completed Phases:**
      - Phase 1: Core setup, navigation, database (SQLite)
      - Phase 2: GoPro WiFi integration, download manager
      - Phase 3: Video library, rename workflow, storage management
      - Phase 4: YouTube OAuth, upload manager, playlist management
      - Phase 5: Cellular optimization, network detection, data usage tracking
      - Phase 6: Background processing, notifications (upload/download progress)
      - Phase 7: Dark mode, theme system, loading states
    - **Remaining:** Phase 8 (testing & deployment - 5-7 days)
    - **Tech Stack:** React Native 0.81.4, Expo 52.x, React Navigation 6.x
    - **Documentation:** `/sailorskills-video/docs/mobile/` (PROGRESS.md, MOBILE_ROADMAP.md)
  - **Current State - Billing Web App:**
    - **Problem:** Mobile browser reloads page during long dives (30-60+ minutes), losing all form state when technician returns to surface. Need to re-select boat, re-enter conditions, restart workflow.
    - **Impact:** Frustrating user experience, lost data, extra time per service
    - **Current Architecture:** Vite web app, no PWA features, no session persistence
  - **Implementation Plan:**
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Video Mobile Final Push**
      - Complete Phase 8: Device testing (iOS/Android), field testing with GoPro, performance optimization
      - App Store preparation: Icons, screenshots, descriptions, privacy policy
      - Deploy to TestFlight (iOS) and Internal Testing (Android)
      - Field testing: Real GoPro cameras, cellular uploads, background processing, battery drain
      - Production release to App Store and Play Store
      - **Deliverables:** Video mobile app published and in production use
    - **Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Billing PWA Quick Fix (Short-term Solution)**
      - Add PWA capabilities: Service workers, offline support, session persistence
      - Implement wake locks to prevent browser sleep during dives
      - Add local storage persistence for form state (auto-save every 30s)
      - Restore form state on page reload (boat selection, conditions, notes)
      - Add "Resume Last Session" prompt on app launch
      - Test: Start service entry, lock phone for 30 min, unlock and verify state restored
      - **Immediate Timestamp Capture on Start/End Service:**
        - Write timestamp to service log immediately when "Start Service" button clicked (not when "Charge Customer" or "Log Only" clicked)
        - Write timestamp to service log immediately when "End Service" button clicked
        - **Rationale:** Overcomes browser persistence issue by capturing critical timestamps before any potential session loss during dive
        - **Impact:** Ensures accurate service time tracking even if browser reloads during dive
        - **Priority:** Critical - include in PWA quick fix implementation
      - **Deliverables:** Billing web app reliably maintains session during dives + accurate timestamp capture
      - **Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days
      - **Why PWA First:** Buys time while Video native proves the React Native stack, solves immediate problem with minimal risk
    - **Phase 3 (Week 4-7): Billing Native Mobile App (Long-term Solution)**
      - Convert Billing to React Native app (leverage Video mobile codebase)
      - Reuse components: Upload manager, network detection, notification service, theme system, database patterns
      - Core features: Service completion workflow, condition tracking (sliders), anode documentation, photo capture/upload, payment processing (Stripe), offline queue
      - Background processing: Save service logs offline, sync when connected
      - Notifications: Service saved, payment processed, sync complete
      - Testing: Field testing during actual service calls, verify no data loss, test offline → online transitions
      - Deploy: TestFlight → Production release
      - **Deliverables:** Billing native app in production, PWA deprecated
      - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks
      - **Leverage from Video Mobile:**
        - 60% of Video mobile code is reusable (upload manager, network service, notifications, database, theme)
        - Authentication patterns already proven
        - Background processing proven reliable
        - Cellular optimization strategies validated
  - **Technical Architecture:**
    - **Video Mobile:** React Native + Expo + SQLite + YouTube API + GoPro HTTP API
    - **Billing PWA (interim):** Vite + Service Workers + IndexedDB + Wake Lock API
    - **Billing Mobile:** React Native + Expo + SQLite + Supabase + Stripe SDK
    - **Shared:** React Native components library (create after Video & Billing mobile both working)
  - **Why This Sequence:**
    1. **Video mobile first** - 87% done, finish it to prove React Native stack works in field
    2. **Billing PWA second** - Quick 3-5 day fix solves immediate session problem with low risk
    3. **Billing native third** - After Video mobile field-tested, confident in React Native approach, reuse 60% of code
    4. **Shared library after** - Extract common patterns once both apps working (don't prematurely optimize)
  - **Services Requiring Native Apps (Priority Order):**
    1. **Video (Q1 2026 - Week 1-2)** - Background uploads critical, 87% done ✅
    2. **Billing/Completion (Q1 2026 - Week 2-7)** - Session persistence critical, PWA → Native
    3. **Operations (Q2 2026)** - Field service logs, offline support, GPS, camera, signature capture
    4. **Inventory (Q2-Q3 2026)** - Barcode scanning, stock checks in warehouse
    5. **Dashboard (Q3 2026)** - Analytics on-the-go (lower priority, web works fine)
    6. **Portal (Future)** - Customer-facing, web is acceptable (mobile-responsive sufficient)
    7. **Estimator (Excluded)** - Customer acquisition tool, web-only by design
  - **Services Staying Web-Only:**
    - **Estimator:** Customer-facing quote builder, intentionally web-only for accessibility
    - **Site:** Marketing site, no native app needed
    - **Booking:** Training scheduling, web sufficient (calendar integration works in browser)
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - **Video Mobile:** 80%+ adoption, 50%+ uploads happen in field (not at desk), 99%+ upload success rate
    - **Billing PWA:** Zero session loss during dives, 100% form state recovery
    - **Billing Mobile:** 90%+ field adoption, <1% data loss, 95%+ offline-to-online sync success
    - **Cross-Platform:** All native apps maintain feature parity with web versions
  - **Impact:**
    - ✅ **Video:** Reliable background uploads over cellular, no laptop required in field
    - ✅ **Billing:** No more lost sessions during dives, confident data entry workflow
    - ✅ **Operations:** Offline service log entry at boat (no internet required), sync when back online

### User Accounts & Multi-User Infrastructure
- [ ] **User Accounts & Comprehensive Audit Logging System**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** Strategic BI Insight service, Referral Tracking, Service Start Notifications, Q2 2026 Ownership & Attribution Tracking
  - **Rationale:** Foundational infrastructure for multi-user/multi-owner operations. Currently no user authentication for staff, no audit trails to track who created/modified data, and no accountability system. Required before onboarding multiple owners, contractors, or employees. Enables revenue attribution, performance tracking, and role-based access control.
  - **Full Proposal:** See `/docs/roadmap-submission-user-accounts-audit-logging.md`
  - **Current Gaps:**
    - No user authentication for internal staff (admin services open to anyone with URL)
    - No audit trails - cannot determine who created/modified service logs, boats, invoices, schedules
    - No accountability - actions are anonymous, no way to trace errors to source
    - No revenue attribution per user/technician
    - Single-user assumption across all services
  - **Key Features:**
    - **User Account System:**
      - User roles: Owner, Admin, Technician, Contractor, Viewer

      - Log who, what, when, action, changes (before/after), IP, service name
      - Add `created_by`, `updated_by`, timestamps to all core tables
      - Audit log viewer with filtering (user, entity type, date range)
      - Historical audit trail for compliance and debugging
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
      - Permission matrix for all features across all services
      - Supabase RLS policies based on user role
      - UI-level guards (hide/disable features by role)
      - API-level permission validation
      - Contractors see only assigned work, Viewers are read-only
    - **Revenue Attribution & Performance Tracking:**
      - Link invoices to service technician
      - Track revenue generated per user
      - Performance metrics: revenue/user, services/user, efficiency ($/hour)
      - Commission calculation support
      - User performance dashboard widgets
  - **Database Schema:**
    - New `users` table: id, email, full_name, role, type, active, hire_date, hourly_rate, preferences
    - New `audit_logs` table: user_id, entity_type, entity_id, action, changes (JSONB), ip_address, service_name, timestamp
    - Add to all tables: `created_by`, `updated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
    - Add to invoices: `service_technician_id` for revenue attribution
    - Add to service_logs: `technician_id`, `revenue_generated`
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1):** User accounts foundation - schema, Supabase Auth setup, user management UI, login flow

    - Recognize and reward top referrers (customers and staff)
    - Enable referral incentive programs (structured rewards for customer/staff referrals)
    - Calculate accurate CAC by source (data-driven marketing decisions)
    - Build referral culture (gamification with leaderboards)
    - Understand word-of-mouth vs. paid marketing effectiveness
    - Attribute revenue to specific team members or customers (who brings in most valuable clients?)
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Q1 User Accounts system (for staff referral attribution)
    - Customer Portal (for "Refer a Friend" feature and reward display)
    - Dashboard analytics infrastructure
  - **Blocks:** Q2 Ownership & Attribution Tracking (referral data feeds into attribution system)
  - **Priority:** Medium-High (Q1 2026 - foundational for customer acquisition understanding and incentive programs)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days (24-32 hours)
    - Database schema & migration: 0.5 day
    - Estimator & Operations integration: 1 day
    - Dashboard reporting: 1 day
    - Portal "Refer a Friend": 0.5-1 day
    - Automated rewards (optional): 0.5 day
    - Testing & documentation: 0.5 day
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - 90%+ of new customers have referral source captured
    - 30%+ of customers come from referrals (customer or staff)
    - Top 10 referrers identified within first month
    - Referral program launches within 60 days (if reward system implemented)
    - Accurate CAC calculated per acquisition channel
  - **Questions for Decision:**
    - Referral reward structure? (Proposed: $50 credit or 10% discount for referrer, 5% discount for referred customer)
    - Reward eligibility? (Proposed: after referred customer completes first paid service)
    - Staff referral rewards different from customer? (Proposed: yes, potentially cash bonus vs. service credit)
    - Track failed referrals (people who inquired but didn't convert)? (Proposed: no, only successful conversions)
    - Unique referral links for all customers or opt-in? (Proposed: all customers get link, feature in Portal)

### Billing & Payment Operations
- [ ] **Service Start Notifications & Safety Check-In System**
  - **Dependencies:** User Accounts & Comprehensive Audit Logging System (needs user roles for technician identification)
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Notify owner and team when technician starts work for operational awareness and safety. When technician clicks "Start Service" in Billing, automatically send text/email notification with service details. Provides safety check-in mechanism - if technician doesn't return/complete service within expected timeframe, team knows something may be wrong. Simple "Don't start the engines" communication to keep everyone informed.
  - **Core Features:**
    - **Automatic Notifications on "Start Service" Click:**
      - Send SMS and email to owner immediately when "Start Service" button clicked
      - Include: Technician name, customer name, boat name, service type, start time, location (if available)
      - Optional: CC other team members based on notification preferences
    - **Safety Check-In Tracking:**
      - Track expected service duration based on service type and boat history
      - Dashboard widget showing active services and elapsed time
      - Visual alert if service exceeds expected duration (e.g., 2x average time)
      - "Service Running Long" notifications (text/email) if no completion after threshold
    - **Service Completion Notification:**
      - Send notification when service marked complete ("Charge Customer" or "Log Only")
      - Include: End time, total duration, services performed, payment status
  - **Notification Content Examples:**
    - **Start Service:** "Brian started diving service on [Boat Name] for [Customer Name] at 9:45 AM. Estimated duration: 2.5 hours."
    - **Running Long:** "⚠️ Diving service on [Boat Name] started 3 hours ago (expected 2.5 hrs). Last check-in: 9:45 AM."
    - **Service Complete:** "✅ Brian completed diving service on [Boat Name] at 12:30 PM. Duration: 2h 45m. Payment: $350 (charged)."
  - **Database Schema:**
    - Add to `service_logs`: `service_started_at: timestamp`, `expected_duration_hours: decimal`, `service_completed_at: timestamp`
    - New `service_notifications` table: `{ service_log_id: uuid, notification_type: 'start'|'running_long'|'complete', sent_at: timestamp, recipients: text[], delivery_status: jsonb }`
    - Update `business_settings` table: Add notification preferences (recipients, thresholds, enabled/disabled toggles)
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - Edge function: `send-service-notification` (triggered by Billing "Start Service" button)
    - SMS: Twilio API integration (or similar)
    - Email: Resend API (already integrated)
    - Background job: Check for long-running services every 15 minutes
    - Settings UI: Configure notification recipients, duration thresholds, opt-in/opt-out per notification type
  - **UI Locations:**
    - **Billing/Completion:** No UI change needed - "Start Service" button triggers notification automatically
    - **Dashboard:** New "Active Services" widget showing in-progress services with elapsed time
    - **Settings Dashboard:** Notification preferences panel (recipients, thresholds, toggle on/off)
    - **Operations:** Optional: Show "Service Started" indicator on customer/boat cards
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Database schema, notification infrastructure (edge function, Twilio setup)
    - **Phase 2 (Week 1):** Integrate with Billing "Start Service" button, send start notifications
    - **Phase 3 (Week 2):** Build "Active Services" dashboard widget, long-running detection
    - **Phase 4 (Week 2):** Settings UI for notification preferences, completion notifications
    - **Phase 5 (Week 2):** Testing (real-world service scenarios), documentation
  - **Safety Benefits:**
    - Team knows when technician is underwater/in potentially dangerous situation
    - Automatic alert if service runs unusually long (potential emergency)
    - Check-in mechanism without requiring manual action from technician
    - Peace of mind for team and technician's family
    - Can track technician location/last known activity if needed
  - **Operational Benefits:**
    - Owner immediately aware of when work starts (no need to ask "did you start yet?")
    - Track service duration in real-time
    - Better scheduling (know when technician will be free for next service)
    - Historical data on actual vs. estimated service duration
    - Improved communication with customers (can inform them when technician started)
  - **Impact:**
    - Enhanced safety for technicians working alone (especially divers)
    - Automatic operational awareness for owner/team
    - Reduced need for check-in calls/texts
    - Early warning system for potential problems
    - Professional communication ("work has started" updates)
    - Foundation for future features (GPS tracking, emergency alerts, time tracking)
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Billing/Completion service (✅ exists)
    - Resend email integration (✅ exists)
    - Twilio SMS integration (new - requires account setup)
    - Settings Dashboard for notification preferences (can be minimal MVP first)
  - **Blocks:** None (independent feature)
  - **Priority:** High (Q1 2026 - safety and operational awareness)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
    - Notification infrastructure: 0.5 day
    - Billing integration: 0.5 day
    - Dashboard widget: 0.5 day
    - Settings UI: 0.5 day
    - Testing & Twilio setup: 0.5-1 day
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - 100% of services trigger start notification
    - 95%+ notification delivery success rate (SMS + email)
    - Zero missed long-running service alerts
    - Owner reports improved awareness and peace of mind
    - Team uses "Active Services" widget daily
  - **Questions for Decision:**
    - SMS provider preference? (Proposed: Twilio - industry standard, reliable)
    - Long-running service threshold? (Proposed: 2x expected duration OR 4 hours, whichever is shorter)
    - Who receives notifications by default? (Proposed: Owner always, other team members opt-in)
    - Include GPS location in notifications? (Proposed: yes if available from mobile device)
    - Emergency escalation if no completion after X hours? (Proposed: manual for now, automated later)

- [ ] **Monthly Payment Method Validation & Pre-Service Workflow**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Proactively verify payment methods are valid before providing service to reduce failed payments, chargebacks, and collections issues. Catch expired/invalid cards before service is performed, giving customers time to update payment info. Improves cash flow and reduces administrative burden of chasing failed payments.
  - **Investigation Required:** Research Stripe API capabilities for payment method validation
    - Can Stripe ping/validate payment methods without charging? (likely: SetupIntent with $0 authorization)
    - Does validation trigger customer notifications or affect their account?
    - Rate limits and costs for monthly validation of all customers?
    - How to handle validation failures (expired cards, insufficient funds, etc.)?
  - **Proposed Workflow:**
    - **Monthly Automated Validation (1st of each month):**
      - Query Stripe for all customers with saved payment methods
      - Ping each payment method to verify validity (likely using SetupIntent or card verification)
      - Log validation results (valid/invalid/expired) to database
      - Generate report of invalid payment methods
    - **Pre-Service Check (Operations workflow):**
      - Before scheduling service, check customer's payment method status
      - Display warning indicator if payment method invalid/expired (visual alert in UI)
      - Optionally block scheduling until payment method updated
      - Send automated notification to customer requesting payment update
    - **Customer Notification Flow:**
      - Email customers with invalid payment methods (friendly reminder)
      - Provide direct link to Portal for updating payment info
      - Escalate if payment not updated within 7 days (second reminder)
      - Operations dashboard shows customers with payment issues
  - **Database Schema:**
    - New `payment_method_validations` table: `{ customer_id: uuid, stripe_payment_method_id: text, validation_date: timestamp, status: 'valid'|'invalid'|'expired'|'declined', error_details: text }`
    - Add `last_payment_validation` and `payment_method_status` to `customers` table
  - **UI Locations:**
    - **Operations:** Visual indicator on customer cards/scheduling view (red badge for invalid payment)
    - **Dashboard:** Report widget showing customers with payment issues
    - **Billing/Completion:** Warning when attempting to charge invalid payment method
    - **Portal:** Prompt customers to update payment method if validation failed
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - Edge function: `validate-payment-methods` (runs monthly via cron job)
    - Stripe API integration: SetupIntent or card verification endpoint
    - Notification service: Send emails via Resend for failed validations
    - Supabase cron job or Vercel cron to trigger monthly validation
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Research Stripe API - determine best validation method, test in Stripe test mode, document findings
    - **Phase 2 (Week 1):** Database schema, validation edge function, logging infrastructure
    - **Phase 3 (Week 2):** Build monthly validation cron job, test with real Stripe data
    - **Phase 4 (Week 2):** Integrate pre-service check into Operations workflow, add UI indicators
    - **Phase 5 (Week 3):** Customer notification system, Portal integration, automated reminder emails
    - **Phase 6 (Week 3):** Dashboard reporting, testing, documentation
  - **Impact:**
    - Reduce failed payment attempts by catching expired/invalid cards proactively
    - Improve cash flow (fewer declined charges, faster collections)
    - Better customer experience (proactive notification vs. failed charge)
    - Reduce administrative overhead (less time chasing failed payments)
    - Prevent service delivery to customers with invalid payment methods
    - Build trust with proactive communication about payment issues
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Stripe integration (✅ already exists)
    - Customer Portal (✅ completed Q4 2025 - customers can update payment methods)
    - Email notification system via Resend (✅ exists)
  - **Blocks:** None (independent feature)
  - **Priority:** Medium-High (Q1 2026 - after critical user accounts work, improves cash flow)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days (24-32 hours)
    - Stripe API research: 0.5 day
    - Database & edge function: 1 day
    - Operations integration: 0.5 day
    - Customer notifications: 1 day
    - Dashboard reporting & testing: 0.5-1 day
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - 90%+ payment methods validated successfully each month
    - 50%+ reduction in failed payment attempts
    - 80%+ of customers with invalid payment methods update within 7 days
    - Zero services provided to customers with invalid payment methods (if blocking enabled)
  - **Questions for Decision:**
    - Should we block scheduling if payment method is invalid? (Proposed: warning only, not hard block)
    - Grace period for expired cards? (Proposed: allow scheduling within 7 days of expiration with warning)
    - Validation frequency? (Proposed: monthly, can adjust based on findings)
    - Customer communication tone? (Proposed: friendly reminder, not punitive)

- [ ] **Customer Payment Method Migration Campaign**
  - **Dependencies:** Customer Portal (completed Q4 2025), Monthly Payment Method Validation (optional - can run independently)
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Many existing customers with active service plans (monthly/quarterly schedules) may not have payment methods on file in the new Stripe system. Need to identify these customers and proactively reach out with a streamlined workflow to capture payment information before their next service. Improves cash flow, reduces failed payment scenarios, and migrates customers to the modern payment system with minimal friction.
  - **Scope:** Identify, communicate with, and convert customers with active services but missing payment methods
    - **Phase 1: Identification & Analysis**
      - Query database to find customers with active service plans (recurring schedules) but no Stripe payment method
      - Segment by service type, plan frequency, customer lifetime value
      - Generate prioritized outreach list (high-value customers first)
      - Calculate potential revenue at risk from missing payment methods
    - **Phase 2: Technical Implementation (Choose One or Both Approaches)**
      - **Option A: Estimator Checkout with Pre-filled Data**
        - Create unique checkout links per customer/boat with pre-populated data
        - Auto-fill: customer name, email, phone, boat details, current service plan
        - Streamlined flow: customer just needs to add payment method and confirm
        - Track conversion rate per link (who completed payment setup)
      - **Option B: Portal Payment Management Page**
        - Build "Payment Methods" section in Portal account settings
        - Allow customers to add/update/remove payment methods
        - Show current payment method status (missing, valid, expired)
        - Display upcoming service schedule requiring payment
        - Send customers directly to Portal payment page via link
      - **Recommendation:** Implement both - Estimator checkout for quick setup, Portal for ongoing management
    - **Phase 3: Communication Strategy & Email Campaign**
      - **Email Content:**
        - Friendly tone: "We've upgraded our payment system..."
        - Highlight benefits of new system: Portal access, online invoices, service history, instant receipts
        - Emphasize new features: View service history, request additional services, track upcoming appointments
        - Include direct link to payment setup (Estimator checkout OR Portal payment page)
        - Provide clear call-to-action: "Update Your Payment Method"
        - Offer support: "Need help? Reply to this email or call [phone]"
      - **Email Sequence:**
        - Email 1: Initial request with feature highlights (send to all identified customers)
        - Email 2: Follow-up reminder after 7 days (if not completed)
        - Email 3: Final reminder after 14 days (with urgency: "Update before your next service on [date]")
        - Optional: Phone call for high-value customers who don't respond
      - **Tracking & Metrics:**
        - Track email open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates
        - Monitor payment method additions via unique links
        - Measure response time (how quickly customers update after email)
        - Flag customers who don't respond for manual outreach
  - **Database Queries:**
    - **Identify Customers Missing Payment Methods:**
      ```sql
      SELECT c.id, c.customer_name, c.email, c.phone,
             b.boat_name, so.service_type, so.plan_interval
      FROM customers c
      JOIN boats b ON c.id = b.customer_id
      JOIN service_orders so ON b.id = so.boat_id
      WHERE so.status = 'active'
        AND so.plan_interval IN ('monthly', 'quarterly')
        AND (c.stripe_customer_id IS NULL
             OR NOT EXISTS (
               SELECT 1 FROM payment_methods pm
               WHERE pm.customer_id = c.id AND pm.status = 'active'
             ))
      ORDER BY c.customer_lifetime_value DESC;
      ```
    - **Calculate Revenue at Risk:**
      ```sql
      SELECT COUNT(*) as customer_count,
             SUM(so.plan_price) as monthly_revenue_at_risk
      FROM customers c
      JOIN boats b ON c.id = b.customer_id
      JOIN service_orders so ON b.id = so.boat_id
      WHERE so.status = 'active'
        AND (c.stripe_customer_id IS NULL OR ...);
      ```
  - **Email Template (Draft):**

  - **Impact:**
    - Migrate existing customers to new payment system proactively
    - Reduce failed payment scenarios (customer already has method on file)
    - Improve cash flow (fewer declined charges, faster collections)
    - Enhance customer experience (introduce Portal and new features)
    - Build foundation for automated recurring billing
    - Reduce manual payment collection effort
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Customer Portal (✅ completed Q4 2025 - if using Portal approach)
    - Stripe integration (✅ exists)
    - Email system via Resend (✅ exists)
    - Database query access (✅ available)
  - **Blocks:** None (independent campaign)
  - **Priority:** Medium-High (Q1 2026 - important for cash flow and system migration)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days (24-32 hours) spread over 3 weeks
    - Database analysis & customer segmentation: 0.5 day
    - Technical implementation (Estimator links OR Portal page): 1-1.5 days
    - Email template & campaign setup: 0.5 day
    - Campaign execution & monitoring: 1 day
    - Follow-up emails & manual outreach: 0.5-1 day
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - 80%+ of identified customers contacted within first week
    - 60%+ email open rate
    - 30%+ click-through rate (customers clicking payment link)
    - 50%+ conversion rate (customers adding payment method)
    - $X monthly revenue secured from payment method additions
    - 90%+ of high-value customers converted within 3 weeks
  - **Questions for Decision:**
    - Which technical approach to prioritize? (Proposed: Start with Estimator pre-filled checkout for speed, add Portal payment page in Phase 2)

### Operations Improvements
- [x] **Historical Service Log Display with Dual Data Source** ✅
  - **Completed:** 2025-11-05
  - **Rationale:** Display 1,191 historical Notion service logs alongside new app-created logs with visual distinction to preserve data integrity
  - **Features Implemented:**
    - Visual styling for historical Notion data (gray background, gray border, monospace font)
    - "(Historical)" badge on Notion service logs
    - Edit/delete buttons hidden for historical data (read-only)
    - Customer name display from joined customers table
    - JSON string parsing for Notion propeller and anode data
    - Handles dual data structures: Notion format (overall_condition) vs app format (location-based)
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - Added `data_source` column to service_logs table (notion | sailorskills | manual)
    - Updated BoatDetailPanel.js query to include `data_source` field
    - Joined customers table for proper name display
    - Parse JSONB strings for Notion propellers/anodes before rendering
    - Conditional rendering based on data_source value
  - **Impact:** ✅ 2.8 years of service history (1,191 records) now visible in Operations UI alongside new logs, maintaining clear distinction between historical import and app-created data
  - **Location:** Operations service → Boats tab → Boat detail panel → Service History Timeline
  - **Documentation:** SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-11-05_DEBUGGING.md

- [x] **Service Forecast Bulk Scheduling Modal** ✅
  - **Completed:** 2025-11-05
  - **Rationale:** Enable bulk scheduling of multiple boats from forecast view with single modal form, replacing navigation-based workflow
  - **Problem:** Bulk schedule button ("Schedule X Boats") navigated to dashboard instead of opening scheduling modal
  - **Root Cause:** `scheduleSelectedBoats()` function used old `window.location.href` navigation pattern while single boat Schedule button had been updated to modal approach
  - **Features Implemented:**
    - Modal-based bulk scheduling for multiple boats simultaneously
    - Shows list of all selected boats in modal for confirmation
    - Single date/service type/amount applied to all boats
    - Real-time total amount calculation (per boat amount × boat count)
    - Creates service orders for all boats in parallel
    - Updates `service_schedules.scheduled_date` for all boats to keep forecast in sync
    - Success toast with boat count confirmation
    - Auto-unchecks all checkboxes after successful scheduling
    - Refreshes forecast to show updated scheduled dates
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - Replaced navigation with `openFormModal()` consistent with single boat pattern
    - Uses `Promise.all()` to create service orders in parallel for performance
    - Generates unique order numbers per boat: `ORD-{timestamp}-{boat_id}`
    - Handles errors gracefully without losing partial progress
    - Maintains form state until successful completion
  - **Impact:** ✅ Streamlined workflow for scheduling multiple boats - team can now schedule 5-10 boats to same date in one operation instead of individual modals. Matches single boat schedule modal pattern from 2025-11-05 session.
  - **Location:** Operations service → Forecast view → Select boats → "Schedule X Boats" button
  - **Commit:** e7fd666 (fix(forecast): open bulk schedule modal instead of navigation)
  - **Documentation:** This roadmap entry

- [x] **Customer Portal - Separated into Independent Service**
  - **Completed:** 2025-10-25 (portal separation complete)
  - **Status:** Portal is now a separate service at https://portal.sailorskills.com
  - **Repository:** https://github.com/standardhuman/sailorskills-portal
  - **Key Features Implemented:** Multi-boat access, dual auth (magic link + password), service history, invoices, messages, service requests, account management
  - **Impact:** ✅ Complete separation achieved, independent deployments, improved security
  - **Next Steps:** Enhance portal features (notifications, better mobile UX, dashboard widgets)

- [ ] **Scheduling Enhancements - Time-Slot Based Scheduling & Drag-and-Drop**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Enhance scheduling system with time-slot based scheduling (using historical service duration data), drag-and-drop rescheduling, and multiple calendar view modes (Day/Week/Month) to improve operational efficiency and scheduling accuracy. Currently scheduling is date-only without time awareness or visual rescheduling capabilities.
  - **Full Proposal:** See `/sailorskills-operations/docs/roadmap-submission-scheduling-enhancements.md`
  - **Features:**
    - **Time-Slot Based Scheduling:**
      - Calculate average service duration per boat from `service_logs.total_hours`
      - Display time slots (e.g., "9:00 AM - 11:30 AM") instead of just dates
      - Configurable business hours (default: 8 AM - 6 PM)
      - Show remaining capacity per time slot
      - Handle boats with no service history (configurable default duration)
    - **Drag & Drop Rescheduling:**
      - Drag scheduled services between dates and time slots
      - Visual feedback during drag (ghost element, valid/invalid drop zones)
      - Real-time conflict detection for overlapping time slots
      - Undo capability for accidental moves
      - Touch support for mobile/tablet devices
      - Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support
    - **Multiple View Modes:**
      - **Day View:** Hourly timeline (8 AM - 6 PM, 30-min increments) - best for daily dispatch planning
      - **Week View:** 7-column grid with time slots - best for weekly route planning
      - **Month View:** Enhanced calendar grid with time blocks - best for long-term planning
      - View switcher UI: [Today] [Day] [Week] [Month]
      - Date picker for navigation, persistent view preference
  - **Database Schema Changes:**
    - Add `scheduled_time TIME` and `estimated_duration_hours DECIMAL(4,2)` to `service_orders` table
    - Create `scheduling_config` table: business hours, default duration, max concurrent services
    - Migration for existing scheduled services
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - Service duration calculation: `SELECT boat_id, AVG(total_hours) FROM service_logs GROUP BY boat_id`
    - Drag & Drop library: `@dnd-kit/core` (modern, accessible) or native HTML5 Drag & Drop
    - Date/Time library: `date-fns` (lightweight)
    - Conflict detection logic, optimistic UI updates with rollback
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - **Phase 1 (1 week):** Foundation - database schema, duration calculation, basic time slot UI
    - **Phase 2 (1 week):** View modes - Day/Week view implementation, view switcher, navigation
    - **Phase 3 (1 week):** Drag & Drop - library integration, conflict detection, undo/redo, accessibility
    - **Phase 4 (ongoing):** Polish - animations, edge cases, performance, user testing
  - **Impact:**
    - Reduce scheduling conflicts by 80%
    - Reduce time to schedule services by 50%
    - Better capacity planning with time-aware scheduling
    - Faster rescheduling with drag-and-drop
    - Improved mobile/tablet scheduling experience for field use
  - **Dependencies:** Existing `service_logs` table with `total_hours` (✅ exists)
  - **Priority:** High (Q1 2026 - critical workflow enhancement)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks (large)
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - 90%+ adoption of new views within 2 weeks
    - 80% reduction in scheduling conflicts
    - 30%+ drag & drop operations from mobile devices
  - **Questions for Review:**
    - Should we support multi-day service windows?
    - Default service duration for boats with no history? (proposed: 2.5 hours)
    - Allow overlapping time slots for multiple technicians?
    - Team/technician assignment in Phase 1 or defer?
    - Include Google Calendar sync in this initiative?

- [ ] **Internal Admin Design System Modernization**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Unify visual design across internal admin services (Dashboard, Operations, Inventory, Completion/Billing, Video, Booking) with modern, polished aesthetic from Billing. Separate internal admin UX from customer-facing Estimator brand. Improve daily experience for team workflows.
  - **Scope:** Internal services only (excludes Estimator, Site)
  - **Visual Updates:**
    - **Border Radius:** Sharp corners (0px) → Rounded (4-12px scale)
    - **Color Palette:** Add purple accent (#667eea) + gradients for modern feel
    - **Shadows:** Minimal flat → Stronger depth (cards, modals, nav)
    - **Interactive States:** Add card elevation on hover, gradient nav accents
    - **Three-Tier Nav:** Keep structure, apply visual polish (rounded active states, gradient backgrounds)
  - **Technical Approach:**
    - Phase 1 (Week 1): Update `sailorskills-shared/src/ui/design-tokens.css` + `styles.css`
    - Phase 2 (Week 1): Pilot implementation on Dashboard, test thoroughly
    - Phase 3 (Week 2): Roll out to Operations → Inventory → Completion

    - Buttons: Rounded corners, keep brightness hover
    - Cards: Rounded + hover lift effect (translateY + shadow)
    - Modals: Rounded, stronger shadows
    - Forms: Rounded inputs, better focus states
    - Navigation (all 3 tiers): Rounded active states, gradient accents
    - Badges: Add gradient variant option
    - New Shared components: Extract Billing's condition sliders, card patterns
  - **Impact:** Unified, modern, delightful UX across all internal tools. Clearer separation between internal admin (modern/polished) and customer acquisition (professional/minimal). Improved daily experience for team with consistent, pleasant interface.
  - **Dependencies:** None (self-contained design system update)
  - **Priority:** High (Q1 2026 - foundational improvement)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 24-35 hours over 3 weeks
    - Shared updates: 6-9 hours
    - Dashboard pilot: 3-4 hours
    - 5 services rollout: 10-15 hours
    - Testing/polish: 5-7 hours

  - **Deliverables:**
    - Updated Shared design tokens with purple palette, radius scale, stronger shadows, gradients
    - Modernized Shared component library (buttons, cards, modals, forms, nav)
    - All 6 internal services using consistent modern styling
    - Visual regression test suite (Playwright screenshots)
    - Design system documentation

- [ ] **Admin Settings & Configuration Panels**
  - **Dependencies:** Customer Portal (completed Q4 2025)
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Need centralized control over business operations: email notifications, pricing variables, and customer-facing content. Currently these are hardcoded or require code changes.
  - **Architecture:** Distributed approach - each service manages its own settings panel to maintain service autonomy
  - **Features by Service:**
    - **Estimator Settings:**
      - Pricing variables panel (anode margin %, service base prices, surcharge rates)
      - Labor rate configuration
      - Tax/fee settings
    - **Operations Settings:**
      - Email toggles (service completion notifications, order confirmations)
      - Customer portal format/content settings (branding, welcome text, feature visibility)
      - Default service templates
    - **Completion Settings:**
      - Email toggles (payment receipts, invoice notifications)
      - Email content configuration (footer text, payment terms)
      - Invoice formatting options
    - **Booking Settings:**
      - Email toggles (booking confirmations, reminders, cancellations)
      - Booking policy text customization
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - New `business_settings` table in Supabase (JSONB for flexibility)
    - Settings structure: `{ service: string, category: string, settings: jsonb }`
    - Edge function for settings validation and defaults
    - React settings panels with form validation
  - **Impact:** Eliminates need for code deployments to adjust pricing, email behavior, or customer-facing content. Enables quick business process changes without developer intervention.
  - **Dependencies:** Customer Portal implementation (portal must exist before format settings can be configured)
  - **Priority:** Medium (Q1 2026 - after customer portal)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days (1 day planning/database, 2-3 days implementing panels across services)

- [ ] **AI-Powered Scheduling Assistant from Email/iMessage**
  - **Dependencies:** User Accounts (for assignment), Scheduling system
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Automate scheduling workflow by using AI to scan Gmail and iMessage for client scheduling requests, understand natural language preferences, and propose schedule dates in Operations. Reduces manual effort of reading messages, interpreting requests, and manually creating schedule entries. Leverages Claude AI for message understanding and intent extraction.
  - **Core Features:**
    - **Message Scanning & Monitoring:**
      - Connect to Gmail via Google Gmail API (OAuth authentication)
      - Connect to iMessage via macOS AppleScript or Messages API (if available)
      - Scan for messages containing scheduling-related keywords (hull cleaning, diving, service, appointment, schedule, etc.)
      - Filter by sender (only existing customers, or learn new contacts)
      - Real-time monitoring with periodic checks (e.g., every 15 minutes)
    - **AI Message Understanding (Claude API):**
      - Pass message content to Claude API with scheduling extraction prompt
      - Extract key information:
        - Customer identity (name, email, phone)
        - Service type requested (hull cleaning, diving, pressure washing, etc.)
        - Preferred date/time (explicit: "next Tuesday", implicit: "sometime next week")
        - Urgency level (ASAP, flexible, specific deadline)
        - Special requirements or notes
        - Boat name (if mentioned)
      - Handle ambiguous requests (multiple possible interpretations)
      - Detect follow-up messages (referencing previous conversation)
    - **Customer Matching:**
      - Match sender to existing customer in database (email, phone, name)
      - If unknown sender, create "potential customer" entry requiring review
      - Link to correct boat if customer has multiple boats
      - Flag if customer not found for manual review
    - **Proposed Schedule Creation:**
      - Generate proposed schedule entry in Operations "Needs Scheduling" queue
      - Populate fields: customer, boat, service type, preferred date range, priority, notes
      - Include original message text for context
      - Tag as "AI-proposed" for review before confirmation
      - Calculate suggested date based on:
        - Customer preference
        - Current schedule availability
        - Historical service frequency for this customer/boat
        - Service duration estimates
    - **Review & Approval Workflow:**
      - Create dedicated "AI Scheduling Suggestions" inbox in Operations
      - Show proposed entries with confidence score (high/medium/low)
      - Display original message alongside proposed schedule
      - Actions: "Approve & Schedule", "Edit & Schedule", "Reject", "Mark as Spam"
      - One-click approval adds to calendar, sends confirmation to customer
      - Track accuracy over time (approved vs. rejected suggestions)
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - **Gmail Integration:**
      - Google Gmail API with OAuth 2.0
      - Watch/subscribe to inbox for new messages (push notifications)
      - Search API for historical message scanning
      - Label processed messages to avoid duplicates
    - **iMessage Integration:**
      - macOS Messages app via AppleScript (if running on Mac)
      - Alternative: Use third-party iMessage API service (less reliable)
      - SQLite database monitoring (Messages app stores in SQLite on Mac)
      - Requires Mac Mini or similar always-on Mac for monitoring
    - **AI Processing:**
      - Claude API (Anthropic) for message understanding
      - Structured prompt engineering for consistent extraction
      - JSON schema response format for parsed scheduling data
      - Fallback to simpler extraction if Claude unavailable
    - **Database Schema:**
      - New `ai_scheduling_suggestions` table: `{ id: uuid, source: 'gmail'|'imessage', message_id: text, sender: text, message_text: text, customer_id: uuid, boat_id: uuid, service_type: text, preferred_date_range: daterange, urgency: text, confidence_score: decimal, status: 'pending'|'approved'|'rejected'|'spam', created_at: timestamp, reviewed_at: timestamp, reviewed_by: uuid }`
      - Add `source_message_id` to `scheduling_queue` table to link approved suggestions
    - **Edge Functions:**
      - `scan-gmail-messages`: Periodically fetch new Gmail messages, send to Claude for parsing
      - `scan-imessage-messages`: Periodically check iMessage database for new messages
      - `process-scheduling-message`: Claude API integration for message understanding
      - `create-scheduling-suggestion`: Create suggestion entry in database
  - **UI Locations:**
    - **Operations:** New "AI Scheduling Suggestions" tab/inbox
      - List view of pending suggestions with confidence scores
      - Side-by-side view: original message + proposed schedule
      - Bulk actions: approve multiple suggestions at once
      - Settings: configure keywords, confidence threshold, auto-approve for high confidence
    - **Settings Dashboard:** AI Scheduling configuration
      - Gmail OAuth connection management
      - iMessage monitoring toggle (if Mac available)
      - Keywords and filters for message scanning
      - Claude API key configuration
      - Auto-approval settings (e.g., auto-approve if confidence > 90%)
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Gmail integration, message fetching, basic keyword filtering
    - **Phase 2 (Week 1-2):** Claude API integration, prompt engineering for scheduling extraction
    - **Phase 3 (Week 2):** Customer matching logic, database schema for suggestions
    - **Phase 4 (Week 2-3):** Operations UI for reviewing suggestions, approval workflow
    - **Phase 5 (Week 3):** iMessage integration (if Mac available), confidence scoring
    - **Phase 6 (Week 3):** Settings configuration, auto-approval rules, accuracy tracking
  - **Example Message Scenarios:**
    - **Explicit:** "Hi! Can you schedule a hull cleaning for my boat next Tuesday around 10am?" → Extract: service=hull_cleaning, date=next_tuesday, time=10am, confidence=high
    - **Vague:** "My boat needs a cleaning sometime soon" → Extract: service=hull_cleaning, urgency=soon, confidence=medium, require manual date selection
    - **Range:** "I need diving service in the next 2 weeks" → Extract: service=diving, date_range=next_2_weeks, confidence=high
    - **Follow-up:** "Actually, can we move that to Thursday instead?" → Detect reference to previous conversation, update existing suggestion
  - **Smart Features (Future Enhancements):**
    - Learn from approval patterns (if certain customer always books Tuesdays, suggest Tuesday)
    - Detect seasonal patterns (spring = more bottom painting requests)
    - Auto-respond with confirmation email once scheduled
    - Handle multi-turn conversations (back-and-forth scheduling negotiation)
    - Integration with Google Calendar to check actual availability before suggesting
  - **Privacy & Security Considerations:**
    - Secure OAuth token storage for Gmail access
    - Encrypt stored message content
    - Respect user privacy - only scan for scheduling keywords, not full message history
    - Clear data retention policy (delete message text after 30 days)
    - Opt-in for customers (can disable AI processing per customer)
  - **Impact:**
    - Dramatically reduce time spent reading/processing scheduling messages
    - Faster response to customer requests (AI processes instantly)
    - Reduce missed scheduling requests (automated monitoring)
    - Improve customer satisfaction (quick acknowledgment of requests)
    - Free up owner time for higher-value work
    - Data-driven insights (most common scheduling patterns, customer preferences)
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - 70%+ of AI suggestions approved without edits (accuracy)
    - 80%+ reduction in time spent processing scheduling messages
    - 90%+ of scheduling messages detected and processed
    - <5% false positives (non-scheduling messages incorrectly flagged)
    - Average response time to scheduling request: <1 hour (vs. hours/days manually)
  - **Dependencies:**
    - Gmail account with API access enabled
    - Mac Mini (or similar) for iMessage monitoring (optional)
    - Claude API account (Anthropic)
    - Operations scheduling system (Needs Scheduling queue - completed Q4 2025)
    - User Accounts for technician assignment
  - **Blocks:** None (standalone feature)
  - **Priority:** Medium-High (Q1 2026 - high-value automation)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks (24-32 hours)
    - Gmail integration: 1 week
    - Claude AI processing: 0.5 week
    - Customer matching + database: 0.5 week
    - Operations UI: 1 week
    - iMessage integration: 0.5 week
    - Settings + testing: 0.5 week
  - **Questions for Decision:**
    - Auto-approve high-confidence suggestions or always require manual review? (Proposed: manual review initially, auto-approve after proven accurate)
    - iMessage integration priority? (Proposed: Phase 2 - Gmail first, iMessage if valuable)
    - Should AI auto-respond to customer? (Proposed: no, just create suggestion for owner to review and respond)
    - Scan all email folders or just Inbox? (Proposed: Inbox only, avoid spam/promotions)
    - Handle non-customer messages (potential new leads)? (Proposed: yes, create "potential customer" entry for follow-up)

- [ ] Enhance packing list automation
- [ ] Improve service history visualization
- [ ] Mobile optimization for field use

- [ ] **Service Forecast Widget Layout Optimization**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Current Service Forecast widgets are stretched full-width across the screen, creating poor visual hierarchy and wasted whitespace. Large numbers and metrics lose impact when spread too wide. Need to implement responsive grid layout with appropriately-sized widgets for better information density and visual appeal.
  - **Current Issues:**
    - Summary widgets (85 boats, 44 due this month, 0 overdue, 44 due soon) stretch full screen width
    - Monthly forecast cards are too wide, making information harder to scan
    - Excessive horizontal whitespace reduces information density
    - Poor visual hierarchy - all widgets same size regardless of importance
    - Not optimized for common screen sizes (looks stretched on large monitors)
  - **Proposed Layout:**
    - **Top Summary Row:** Grid layout (2x2 or 4 columns) for key metrics
      - "Boats with Predictions" + "Due This Month" in top row
      - "Overdue" + "Due Soon (Next 2 Weeks)" in bottom row
      - Each widget: max-width 300-400px, responsive grid
    - **Monthly Forecast Cards:** 3-4 column grid instead of full-width stretching
      - Cards: max-width 280-320px each
      - Responsive: 4 cols desktop (>1400px), 3 cols tablet (768-1400px), 2 cols mobile (<768px)
      - Maintain current card content (month name, boat count, boat list)
    - **Visual Improvements:**
      - Add subtle shadows/borders to define widget boundaries
      - Use container max-width (e.g., 1600px) to prevent excessive stretching
      - Better spacing between widgets (16-24px gaps)
      - Maintain current "Current" badge and highlight styling
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - Update CSS Grid layout in Service Forecast component
    - Add responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)
    - Set max-width constraints on widget containers
    - Maintain existing functionality (Refresh Predictions, Export CSV)
    - Test on various screen sizes (1920px, 1440px, 1280px, 768px, 375px)
  - **Design Reference:**
    - Similar to Insight service dashboard widgets (compact, grid-based)
    - Follow internal admin design system (rounded corners, modern spacing)
    - Maintain consistency with Operations dashboard layouts
  - **Impact:**
    - Improved visual hierarchy - easier to scan and understand
    - Better information density - more content visible without scrolling
    - Professional appearance - appropriate sizing for business analytics
    - Responsive across screen sizes - works well on tablets and small laptops
    - Reduced eye strain - less horizontal scanning required
  - **Implementation Phases:**
    - **Phase 1 (Day 1):** Update summary widget grid layout (2x2 grid for top metrics)
    - **Phase 2 (Day 1):** Implement responsive monthly forecast card grid (3-4 columns)
    - **Phase 3 (Day 2):** Add container max-width, spacing adjustments, visual polish
    - **Phase 4 (Day 2):** Test across screen sizes, adjust breakpoints, verify responsiveness
    - **Phase 5 (Day 2):** Deploy to preview, gather feedback, final adjustments
  - **Dependencies:** None (self-contained CSS/layout changes)
  - **Priority:** Medium-High (Q1 2026 - quick win, improves daily UX)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
    - Layout restructure: 0.5 day
    - Responsive grid implementation: 0.5 day
    - Visual polish & spacing: 0.5 day
    - Testing across devices: 0.5 day
    - Deployment & verification: 0.5 day
  - **Success Metrics:**
    - Widgets fit within 1600px max-width container
    - Monthly forecast cards: 3-4 visible on standard laptop (1440px screen)
    - No horizontal scrolling required on 1280px screens
    - Maintains readability and visual hierarchy across all breakpoints
    - Positive feedback from daily users (cleaner, more professional appearance)
  - **Service Location:** Operations service (Service Forecast page) or Insight service (if forecast moved there)
  - **Related Work:** Can apply similar layout improvements to other dashboard pages if successful

- [ ] **Implement Development Branch Strategy for All Services**
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Blocks:** Comprehensive Responsive Testing (needs preview deployments for testing)
  - **Rationale:** Currently all 10 services develop directly on `main` branch with immediate production deployment on every push. This creates significant risks: untested code can reach production, no staging environment for integration testing, difficulty rolling back problematic deployments, and inability to test cross-service features together. Need proper development → staging → production workflow with safety gates.
  - **Current State:**
    - All services (Portal, Operations, Billing/Completion, Estimator, Dashboard, Inventory, Booking, Video, Site, Shared) use single `main` branch
    - Every push to `main` triggers immediate Vercel production deployment
    - No `develop`, `staging`, or formal branching strategy exists
    - Vercel preview deployments available but not utilized
    - CLAUDE.md instructs to push directly to main after local testing
    - Only 1 feature branch exists across all 10 services (estimator feature/transaction-viewing)
  - **Proposed Workflow:** Modified GitHub Flow with `develop` branch
    - **Branch Structure:** `feature/* → develop (staging) → main (production)`
    - **Development Process:**
      - Create feature branches from `develop` for new work
      - Feature branch PRs merge to `develop` after review
      - `develop` auto-deploys to Vercel preview URL (staging environment)
      - Feature branches get individual preview URLs for PR review
      - `main` remains production-only, updated via PR from `develop`
      - Emergency hotfixes can bypass and go direct to `main` with backport to `develop`
    - **Benefits:**
      - Leverages existing Vercel preview deployment infrastructure (no new tools needed)
      - Staging environment for integration testing before production
      - Test database migrations on preview deployment first
      - Coordinate cross-service releases (test compatible versions together on develop)
      - Easy rollbacks (revert PR to main)
      - Individual preview URLs for every feature PR
  - **Implementation Plan:**
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Core Services Setup
      - Create `develop` branches for Portal, Operations, and Billing/Completion
      - Update Vercel project settings (main = production, develop = preview)
      - Test workflow with small feature on each service
      - Document preview URLs and staging access
    - **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Remaining Services Rollout
      - Create `develop` branches for remaining 7 services (Estimator, Dashboard, Inventory, Booking, Video, Site)
      - Create `develop` branch for sailorskills-shared (special handling as submodule)
      - Update git submodule references in services to point to shared@develop during development
      - Verify all services have working preview deployments
    - **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Documentation & Training
      - Update all CLAUDE.md files with new branching workflow
      - Document: feature branch creation, PR process, staging testing procedures, promote-to-production process
      - Create workflow diagram showing feature → develop → main flow
      - Document emergency hotfix procedure (when to bypass develop)
      - Add database migration testing workflow (test on develop preview first)
    - **Phase 4 (Week 4):** Protection & Validation
      - Configure GitHub branch protection rules on all `main` branches
      - Prevent direct pushes to `main` (require PR from develop)
      - Set up status checks for automated tests (where applicable)
      - Document rollback procedures (revert commits, revert merges)
      - Test full workflow end-to-end on all services
      - Update project manager guidelines in root CLAUDE.md
  - **Special Considerations:**
    - **Git Submodules (sailorskills-shared):** Need coordinated strategy - create shared@develop, services reference shared@develop during development, only update to shared@main when promoting to production. Document submodule branch coordination workflow.
    - **Database Migrations:** Establish testing workflow - always test migrations on `develop` preview deployment before running on production. Document migration rollback procedures.
    - **Cross-Service Dependencies:** When multiple services need compatible changes (e.g., database schema change affecting Portal + Operations + Billing), coordinate versions on `develop` branches and test together before promoting to `main`.
    - **Environment Variables:** Document any differences between develop (staging) and main (production) environment configs.
  - **Impact:**
    - **Safety:** Significantly reduced risk of production bugs (staging environment catches issues first)
    - **Testing:** Ability to test in production-like environment before release
    - **Collaboration:** Better code review process with preview URLs
    - **Rollbacks:** Easier to revert problematic changes (just revert PR)
    - **Coordination:** Can test cross-service features together on develop before production
    - **Confidence:** Team can deploy with higher confidence knowing changes passed staging validation
  - **Dependencies:** None (self-contained workflow improvement, leverages existing Vercel infrastructure)
  - **Priority:** High (reduces production risk, enables safer rapid development)
  - **Estimated Effort:** 12-16 hours spread over 4 weeks
    - Branch creation & Vercel configuration: 4-6 hours
    - Documentation updates: 3-4 hours
    - GitHub protection configuration: 2-3 hours
    - Testing & validation across all services: 3-3 hours
  - **Success Criteria:**
    - All 10 services have `develop` branch created and set as default branch for development
    - Vercel preview URLs working for all service `develop` branches
    - All CLAUDE.md files updated with new workflow instructions
    - Branch protection active on all `main` branches (prevent direct pushes)
    - Emergency hotfix procedure documented
    - At least one feature successfully deployed through full workflow (feature → develop → main) on each service
    - sailorskills-shared submodule workflow documented and validated

### Quality Assurance & Testing
- [ ] **Comprehensive Responsive Testing Across All Services**
  - **Dependencies:** Development Branch Strategy (needs preview deployments for testing)
  - **Blocks:** None
  - **Rationale:** Currently no systematic responsive testing across the 10-service suite.
