# Migration Completion Guide

## Quick Summary

**Status:** 9 of 13 functions migrated âœ…

**Remaining:** 4 functions need to be created

## Option 1: Manual Completion (Fastest)

Since you're hitting the Vercel limit NOW, the quickest solution:

1. Deploy the 9 completed functions immediately:
```bash
cd sailorskills-billing
supabase functions deploy boats
supabase functions deploy customer-details
supabase functions deploy boat-anodes  
supabase functions deploy customer-services
supabase functions deploy service-logs
supabase functions deploy save-conditions
supabase functions deploy save-service-log
supabase functions deploy charge-customer
supabase functions deploy stripe-customers
supabase functions deploy send-receipt
```

2. Update your frontend to use ONLY these 10 functions for now
3. This brings you down from 13 to 3 Vercel functions (below the limit!)
4. Complete remaining 4 functions later

## Option 2: Complete All Functions First

I can create the remaining 4 functions:
- finalize-service-inventory
- invoices  
- search-customers-with-boats
- send-email

Then deploy all 13 at once.

## Which approach do you prefer?
