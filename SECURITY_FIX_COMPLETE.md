# Security Fix Complete - Operations Authentication

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## Critical Vulnerability - RESOLVED

### Original Issue
Operations admin dashboard was **publicly accessible** without any authentication, exposing:
- Customer names and contact information
- Boat names and service schedules
- Service history and business operations data

**URL affected:** https://sailorskills-operations.vercel.app

### Fix Applied

**Files Modified:**
1. `sailorskills-operations/src/main.js`
   - Added `requireAuth()` call before initializing dashboard
   - Added `authenticated` class to body after successful auth
   - Added logout handlers for navigation

2. `sailorskills-operations/index.html`
   - Added CSS to hide content until authentication verified
   - Content remains hidden with `opacity: 0` until auth succeeds

3. `sailorskills-operations/src/auth/auth.js`
   - Fixed build error by replacing shared package import
   - Direct Supabase client import instead of shared package

**Commits:**
- `4c1d30c` - Initial security fix implementation
- `b810c0b` - Simplified logout import
- `ee25dc8` - Fixed Supabase import for successful build

### Verification Results

**Test Date:** October 24, 2025 18:06 PST

**Before Fix:**
```
URL: https://sailorskills-operations.vercel.app
Status: ❌ Publicly accessible
Content visible: YES (CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE)
Customer data exposed: YES
```

**After Fix:**
```
URL: https://sailorskills-operations.vercel.app
Status: ✅ Redirects to login
Redirect URL: https://sailorskills-operations.vercel.app/login.html
Content visible: NO
Customer data protected: YES
```

**Screenshot Evidence:**
- Before: Customer names visible (Sharon Greenhagen, Gavin Corn, Fred Cook, etc.)
- After: Login page shown, no customer data visible

| Service | Auth Required | Status | Test Result |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **Operations** | ✅ Yes | ✅ **FIXED** | Redirects to login |
| **Dashboard** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Working | Auth enforced |
| **Inventory** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Working | Auth enforced |
| **Billing** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Not tested | Requires testing |
| **Estimator** | ❌ No (Public) | ✅ Correct | Public access |
| **Booking** | ❌ No (Public) | ✅ Correct | Public access |

## Session Security Configuration

All authenticated services now use consistent session settings:

- **Session Duration:** 8 hours
- **Storage:** sessionStorage (clears on tab close)
- **Authentication Method:**
  - Operations: Supabase Auth (email/password)
  - Dashboard: SimpleAuth (password hash)
  - Inventory: InventoryAuth (password hash)
  - Billing: SimpleAuth (password hash)

---

## How to Login

### Operations Service
**URL:** https://sailorskills-operations.vercel.app

**Credentials:**
- Email: standardhuman@gmail.com
- Password: KLRss!650

**Login Flow:**
1. Navigate to Operations URL
2. Automatically redirected to /login.html
3. Enter email and password
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Redirected back to admin dashboard

### Other Admin Services
**Dashboard:** Simple password authentication
**Inventory:** Simple password authentication
**Billing:** Simple password authentication

*(These use password-only auth, not email)*

---

## Testing Performed

### 1. Authentication Enforcement
- ✅ Operations now requires login
- ✅ Content hidden until authenticated
- ✅ Redirect to login page works
- ✅ No customer data visible without auth

### 2. Build and Deployment
- ✅ Local build succeeds
- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ All dependencies resolved

### 3. Session Management
- ✅ 8-hour session configured
- ✅ sessionStorage implementation
- ⚠️ Logout button (needs manual testing)

---

## Next Steps Recommended

### High Priority
1. **Test Billing Authentication**
   - Verify Billing service requires login
   - Test with Playwright
   - Ensure no public data exposure

2. **Test Logout Functionality**
   - Manually test logout on all services
   - Verify logout buttons are visible and clickable
   - Confirm redirect to login after logout

3. **Standardize Authentication**
   - Consider moving all services to Supabase Auth
   - Use consistent credentials across services
   - Centralize auth in shared package (if build issues resolved)

### Medium Priority
4. **Add 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**
   - Implement for high-sensitivity services (Operations, Billing)
   - Supabase Auth supports MFA out of the box

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Track login attempts
   - Log authentication failures
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

6. **Session Activity Tracking**
   - Auto-logout on inactivity
   - "Last active" timestamp
   - Session expiry warnings

### Low Priority
7. **Password Rotation**
   - Establish password rotation schedule
   - Update all password hashes in environment variables
   - Document password management process

8. **Security Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for failed login attempts
   - Monitor for brute force attacks
   - Regular security audits
