## Next Session: Execute Production Migration

### Critical Pre-Migration Checklist

**MUST DO BEFORE MIGRATION:**

1. **✅ Database Backup (REQUIRED)**
   - **Option A (Recommended):** Supabase Dashboard
     - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fzygakldvvzxmahkdylq
     - Navigate to: Database → Backups
     - Verify: Recent backup exists (Supabase auto-backups daily)
     - Optional: Create manual backup if available

   - **Option B:** Point-in-Time Recovery
     - Supabase Pro has PITR (7-day WAL archive)
     - Can restore to any point in time

   - **Note:** Local pg_dump failed (version mismatch: local v14 vs server v17)

2. **📋 Team Notification** (Recommended)
   - Migration will take 1-2 hours
   - 1,632 historical invoices will appear in customer portal
   - Low-traffic time recommended

3. **⏰ Time Allocation**
   - Block 1-2 hours for migration
   - Have rollback plan ready if needed

## Migration Execution Steps

### Working Directory:
```bash
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/scripts/zoho-migration
```

### Phase 1: Analysis (Already Done - Skip if Desired)
```bash
npm run analyze
# Reviews: 174 customers, 1,633 invoices, 1,552 payments
```

### Phase 2: Import Invoices (30-45 min)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Set DRY_RUN=false in .env file
# Or run with environment variable:
DRY_RUN=false npm run import-invoices

# Expected results:
# - 1,632 invoices imported
# - 1 invoice skipped (General Customer - no email)
# - 1,278 Stripe payment references
# - 280 Zoho payment references
```

**Checkpoint - Verify:**
```bash
source ../../db-env.sh
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE invoice_number LIKE 'ZB-%'"
# Expected: 1632
```

### Phase 3: Import Zoho Payments (15-20 min)
```bash
DRY_RUN=false npm run import-payments

# Expected results:
# - ~283 Zoho payment records created
# - Linked to invoices
```

**Checkpoint - Verify:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE payment_method='zoho'"
# Expected: ~280-283
```

### Phase 4: Link Service Logs (20-30 min)
```bash
DRY_RUN=false npm run link-service-logs

# Expected results:
# - 1,456 service logs processed
# - High confidence matches via payment_intent
# - Medium confidence via date heuristics
# - Some unlinked (manual review CSV generated)
```

**Checkpoint - Verify:**
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_logs WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL"
# Expected: Varies (aim for >50% linkage)
```

### Phase 5: Validation (5 min)
```bash
npm run validate

# Reviews validation-results.json
# All checks should pass
```

### Phase 6: Portal Testing (10 min)
1. Go to: https://sailorskills-portal.vercel.app
2. Login: standardhuman@gmail.com / KLRss!650
3. Verify invoices display correctly
4. Check payment status

---

## If Something Goes Wrong: ROLLBACK

### Emergency Rollback Procedure:
```bash
npm run rollback
# Type "yes" to confirm

# This will:
# - Delete all ZB-* invoices
# - Clear service_log.invoice_id links
# - Restore to pre-migration state
```

## Important Notes

### Customer Mapping Details:
- **Total Zoho customers:** 174
- **Automatically matched:** 167 (by email)
- **Manually mapped:** 5 (email mismatches - already in customer-mapping.json)
- **Missing customers created:** 14 (already in database)
- **Truly unmatched:** 2 (no email - Joseph Cunliffe duplicate, General Customer)
- **Final coverage:** 172/174 = 98.9%

### Invoice Coverage:
- **Total invoices:** 1,633
- **Will be imported:** 1,632 (99.94%)
- **Will skip:** 1 (General Customer - no email, no customer match)

### Pagination Fix:
- **Bug fixed:** Supabase 1000-row limit
- **Service logs:** Now correctly fetches all 1,456 (was missing 456)
- **Invoices:** Handles >1000 with pagination

### Database Schema Notes:
- `customers.name` (not first_name/last_name)
- `invoices.payment_method` (not payment_id for initial import)
- `service_logs.invoice_id` (linkage field)
- `payments.stripe_payment_intent_id` (not stripe_payment_intent)
