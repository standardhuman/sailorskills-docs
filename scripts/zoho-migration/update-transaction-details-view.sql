-- Update transaction_details view to show boat names from linked service logs
-- Date: 2025-10-28
-- Purpose: Fix "Boat" column in billing transactions to show boat names for Zoho invoices
--
-- Issue: Zoho invoices have boat_details = {} (empty JSON) and boat_id = NULL
-- Solution: When boat_details is empty, get boat info from linked service_log's boat

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW transaction_details AS

  -- Use boat details from invoice if NOT NULL and NOT empty {}
  -- Otherwise get from service_log's boat (for Zoho invoices linked to services)
