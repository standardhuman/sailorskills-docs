# Session Summary - October 23, 2025
## Notion Data Import: Investigation & Test Implementation

---

## 🎯 Original Problem

**Issue:** Two boats (Tandem and Indefatigable) were searchable in Billing by customer name, showing email and payment info, but their boat data wasn't appearing. They were also missing from Operations entirely.

**Impact:** Customer Kimber Oswald (Tandem) and John Hess (Indefatigable) couldn't access their service history or boat information.

---

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### Root Cause Identified

**Primary Issue:** 51 customers from the Zoho→Stripe migration were never imported into the Supabase database, despite existing in Stripe with payment methods.

**Secondary Issue:** Boat data (Tandem, Indefatigable) existed in Notion but was never imported into Supabase, even though a partial Notion import had occurred for other boats.

### Data Flow Breakdown

```
ZOHO (Original CRM)
  ↓ [Migration completed]
STRIPE (Payment Processing) - 117 customers total
  ↓ [Sync incomplete - 51 customers never imported]
SUPABASE (Application DB) - Only 66 Stripe customers imported
  ↓
❌ Missing: Kimber Oswald, John Hess, + 49 others

NOTION (Operational Data)
  ↓ [Partial import occurred]
SUPABASE (Application DB)
  ↓
❌ Missing: Tandem, Indefatigable, + other boats
```

### Key Findings

1. **55 total Stripe customers missing from Supabase**
   - 51 from Zoho migration
   - 4 from other sources

2. **Notion export contains:**
   - 192 boats with complete data
   - ~3,000+ service logs
   - Full service history from 2023-present

3. **Why search was working in Billing:**
   - Billing searches Stripe API directly (by email)
   - Found customer in Stripe ✅
   - Tried to fetch boat from Supabase ❌ (not there)
   - Showed customer-only result

4. **Why nothing showed in Operations:**
   - Operations only queries Supabase
   - No customer or boat records ❌

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Test Import Successfully Completed

**Imported 2 boats with full history:**

**Tandem** (Kimber Oswald)
- ✅ Customer created: `kimber.oswald@gmail.com`
- ✅ Linked to Stripe: `cus_NeTBPo43rYrKO5`
- ✅ Boat created: Pearson 36' sailboat, monohull
- ✅ Location: Berkeley Marina, Dock N, Slip 116
- ✅ **30 service logs imported** (2023-2025)
  - Paint conditions, growth levels, anode states
  - Time tracking (time in/out, duration)
  - Service notes

**Indefatigable** (John Hess)
- ✅ Customer created: `jhess1024@gmail.com`
- ✅ Linked to Stripe: `cus_P8gUccUBIqigHm` (primary of 2 Stripe accounts)
- ✅ Boat created: Hallberg-Rassy HR-43 Mk1, 43ft, monohull
- ✅ Location: Berkeley Marina, Dock N, Slip 117
- ✅ **19 service logs imported** (2023-2025)

**Total: 49 complete service records with full history now accessible!**

### 2. Fixed Data Issues

- **Boat type field mapping:** Corrected `type` field to use `'sailboat'`/`'powerboat'` instead of `'sail'`/`'power'` (database constraint)
- **Display consistency:** Both Billing and Operations now show correct boat types and hull types
- **Stripe linkage:** All imported customers properly linked to their Stripe accounts

### 3. Created Import Infrastructure

**Working Scripts** (`/sailorskills-billing/scripts/`)
- ✅ `import_test_boats.mjs` - Main import script (tested & working)
- ✅ `fix_boat_types.mjs` - Type field corrector
- ✅ `check_payment_methods.mjs` - Payment method verifier
- ✅ Multiple audit/investigation scripts

**Import Script Features:**
- Reads Notion Client List CSV for boat/customer data
- Reads per-boat Conditions CSVs for service history
- Reads per-boat Admin CSVs for time tracking
- Links customers to Stripe by email
- Handles duplicates (skips existing records)
- Validates required fields (customer_id, service_type, etc.)
- Uses service role key to bypass RLS policies

### 4. Documentation Created

**Three comprehensive documents:**

1. **DATA_INTEGRITY_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md**
   - Complete root cause analysis
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Specific findings for Tandem & Indefatigable
   - List of all 55 missing customers

2. **DATA_IMPORT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md**
   - Test import results
   - Fields currently captured vs. still needed
   - Next steps for full import
   - Schema notes and considerations

3. **SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-10-23.md** (this file)
   - Complete session overview
   - Next session pickup instructions

## 📋 Data Currently Being Imported

### From Notion Client List CSV
- Customer: first name, last name, email
- Boat: name, make, type, hull type, length
- Location: marina, dock, slip
- Configuration: propeller count

### From Notion Service Conditions CSV
- Service date
- Paint condition (overall)
- Growth level
- Anode conditions (as JSON: `{ overall: "Good" }`)
- Propeller condition (as JSON array)
- Thru-hull condition
- Service notes

### From Notion Admin CSV
- Time in / Time out (HH:MM format)
- Total hours (calculated or from Duration field in minutes)

### From Stripe API
- stripe_customer_id (linked by email match)
- Payment methods (fetched by Billing app on-demand, not stored in Supabase)

---

## 🔧 Data Still Available But Not Yet Imported

### From Notion Client List (columns available in CSV)
- **Start** (column 8) - Service start month (1-12)
- **Interval** (column 9) - Service interval in months (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Charge By** (column 10) - Charging method: "Length", "Flat Rate", etc.
- **Plan** (column 11) - Plan status: "Subbed", "Paused", "One-Time", etc.
- **Phone** (column 7) - Phone numbers where available in Notion
- **Start Time** (column 6) - Next scheduled service time
- **Avg Duration** (column 22) - Average service duration in minutes
- **Paint Model** (column 14) - e.g., "Pettit Trinidad"
- **Paint Brand** (column 15) - e.g., "Pettit"
- **Paint Type** (column 16) - "Hard", "Ablative", etc.
- **UW/DW** (column 29) - "Upwind" or "Downwind" (usage pattern?)
- **Anodes** (column 12) - Anode locations list

### From Zoho CSV (`~/Downloads/Contacts.csv`)
- **Phone** - More complete phone data (Phone + MobilePhone columns)
- **Billing Address** - Street, City, State, Country, Zip
- **Additional customer details** where Notion data is missing

### Schema Considerations
- **customers table** only has: id, stripe_customer_id, email, name, phone, birthday, created_at, updated_at
  - No billing address fields (would need migration to add)
  - No payment method fields (Billing fetches from Stripe directly)

- **boats table** has many fields and likely has room for service scheduling fields
  - Need to verify which columns exist for Start, Interval, Plan, etc.
  - May need migration to add new columns

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Questions

### 1. Payment Methods Not Showing in Billing
**Status:** Likely a caching issue

**Details:**
- Payment methods exist in Stripe (verified for both test customers)
- Kimber: Visa ****8690 (exp 9/2024) ⚠️ EXPIRED
- John: Visa ****6740 (exp 7/2027)
- `customers` table has no payment method columns
- Billing fetches from Stripe API using `stripe_customer_id`

**Action Required:** User should hard refresh Billing page (Cmd+Shift+R)

**Alternative:** May need to check Billing's payment method fetching logic

### 2. Disk Space
**Issue:** User's disk is 98% full (only 21GB free)

**Impact:**
- Full Notion export is large (~2.4MB ZIP, expands much larger)
- May need to process incrementally
- Consider cleanup before full import

**Current Status:** Test import used extracted CSVs in `/tmp` to save space

### 3. Hull Type Display Capitalization
**Status:** Cosmetic difference, not a bug

- Database stores: `hull_type: "monohull"`
- Operations displays: "Monohull" (capitalized)
- Billing displays: "monohull" (raw value)
- Both are correct, just different UI formatting choices

### 4. Questions for Next Session

**Schema Questions:**
- Should we add billing address columns to customers table?
- Do boats table columns exist for service scheduling (Start, Interval, Plan)?
- Or should we create new columns?

**Data Questions:**
- What to do about boats with no email? (can't link to Stripe)
- Should we import Zoho boats that aren't in Notion?
- How to handle customers with multiple Stripe accounts? (like John Hess)

**Process Questions:**
- Run full import all at once or in batches?
- Should we verify all 192 boats or random sample after import?
- Keep test boats (Tandem, Indefatigable) or re-import them with full script?

## 🚀 Next Session: Ready to Execute

### Prerequisites

✅ **Already Done:**
1. Notion export available: `~/Downloads/ExportBlock-d3a206cd-be40-4d00-8b64-3610016343bb-Part-1.zip`
2. Zoho export available: `~/Downloads/Contacts.csv`
3. Test import successful and verified
4. Import scripts tested and working
5. Service role key available
6. All scripts committed to GitHub

### User Verification Needed Before Full Import

**Please check:**
1. ✅ Tandem and Indefatigable appear correctly in both apps?
2. ⏳ Payment methods showing after hard refresh in Billing?
3. ✅ Service history looks correct with proper dates and conditions?
4. ⏳ Any data fields missing or incorrect?

### Development Tasks for Next Session

**Phase 1: Enhance Import Script (30-60 min)**

1. **Inspect boats table schema** to identify available columns
   ```bash
   node -e "import('@supabase/supabase-js').then(({createClient})=>{
     const supabase=createClient(URL,KEY);
     supabase.from('boats').select('*').limit(1).then(({data})=>
       console.log(Object.keys(data[0])));
   });"
   ```

2. **Add Notion fields to import** (service scheduling, paint details, etc.)
   - Map to existing boat columns or document need for migrations
   - Add phone number handling

3. **Add Zoho data merge** (phone, address where missing)
   - Match by email
   - Use as fallback when Notion data missing

4. **Test enhanced script** on Tandem & Indefatigable
   - Delete existing records first or verify update logic
   - Confirm additional fields appear

**Phase 2: Full Import (1-2 hours depending on data volume)**

1. **Extract all Notion data** (if disk space allows)
   ```bash
   cd /tmp && mkdir notion_full_import
   unzip ~/Downloads/ExportBlock...zip -d notion_full_import
   ```

2. **Create `import_all_boats.mjs`**
   - Based on enhanced `import_test_boats.mjs`
   - Process all 192 boats from Client List CSV
   - Load per-boat service CSVs dynamically
   - Log progress and errors

3. **Run import with monitoring**
   ```bash
   node import_all_boats.mjs 2>&1 | tee import_full_log.txt
   ```

4. **Expected results:**
   - ~192 boats imported
   - ~200 customers created/updated
   - ~3,000+ service logs imported
   - Processing time: ~10-30 minutes (with Stripe API rate limits)

**Phase 3: Verification (30 min)**

1. **Check import stats**
   - Count customers, boats, service_logs in Supabase
   - Verify no errors in log file

2. **Spot check boats in both apps**
   - Random sample of 5-10 boats
   - Verify customer linkage
   - Check service history displays

3. **Validate Stripe linkage**
   - Confirm payment methods appearing
   - Check customers without Stripe IDs

4. **Document any issues**

**Phase 4: Cleanup & Documentation (15 min)**

1. Commit final import script
2. Update documentation with results
3. Create migration scripts if needed for new columns
4. Git commit and push all changes

export VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[from .env file]

# Stripe
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[from .env file]
```

**Location:** Keys available in `/Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-billing/.env`

---

## 💡 Key Learnings & Notes

### Database Constraints Discovered
1. **boats.type** field has check constraint: only accepts `'sailboat'` or `'powerboat'` (not `'sail'`/`'power'`)
2. **service_logs** requires both `boat_id` AND `customer_id` (NOT NULL)
3. **service_logs** requires `service_type` field (we use `'cleaning'`)
4. Boat/customer inserts require service role key due to RLS policies

### Notion Data Structure
- Main CSV: Client List with all boats
- Per-boat folders with:
  - `[Boat] Admin` CSV - time tracking data
  - `[Boat] Service Log/[Boat] Conditions` CSV - service conditions
  - Individual .md files per service (not imported)
  - Some boats have photos (not imported yet)

### Stripe Integration
- Payment methods NOT stored in Supabase
- Billing app fetches them real-time from Stripe API
- Only `stripe_customer_id` is stored in customers table
- This is correct architecture (avoids data sync issues)

### Import Performance
- 2 boats + 49 service logs imported in ~5 seconds
- Full import estimated: 10-30 minutes (Stripe API lookups are rate-limited)
- Can run in background and monitor progress
