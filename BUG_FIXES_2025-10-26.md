# Critical Bug Fixes - 2025-10-26

## üêõ Bugs Discovered in Production Testing

Testing revealed 3 critical bugs blocking the integration:

### Bug #1: Billing Modal Stock Display Inconsistency ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue:** Modal showed conflicting stock information
- Header: "Low stock alert: Only 1 units available"
- Items: "(0 available)" and "(out of stock)"
- Conflict with Inventory Catalog showing "Low Stock (3)", "Low Stock (1)"

**Root Cause:**
- "Retrieve" section showed `quantity_available` (on_hand - allocated)
- If inventory was allocated elsewhere, showed "(0 available)" despite stock existing
- "Order" section hardcoded "(out of stock)" without checking inventory

**Fix:** `src/admin/inventory-review-modal.js`
- Now shows: `(X in stock, Y available)` for clarity
- "Order" section shows actual stock: `(X in stock - need to order more)`
- Helps users understand the difference between total stock and unallocated stock

**Files Changed:**
- `sailorskills-billing/src/admin/inventory-review-modal.js`

---

### Bug #2: Replenishment Queue "Error loading data" ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue:** Inventory Orders view showed "Error loading data" in Replenishment Queue section

**Root Cause:**
- `replenishment_queue` table created without RLS policies
- Inventory app (using anon key) blocked from reading table
- JavaScript threw error, caught, displayed "Error loading data"

**Fix:** Database Migration `013_fix_integration_bugs.sql`
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE replenishment_queue ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow public read (Inventory app needs this)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view replenishment queue" ON replenishment_queue
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow public update (for marking ordered/received)
CREATE POLICY "Public can update replenishment status" ON replenishment_queue
FOR UPDATE USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

**Files Changed:**
- `sailorskills-billing/supabase/migrations/013_fix_integration_bugs.sql`

---

### Bug #3: Operations Packing List "Error loading packing list" ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue:** Operations Packing Lists view showed "Error loading packing list"

**Root Cause:**
- `boat_service_flags` table created without proper RLS policies
- Operations app (using anon key) blocked from reading table
- Query failed, error displayed

**Fix:** Database Migration `013_fix_integration_bugs.sql`
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE boat_service_flags ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow public read (Operations needs this)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view boat service flags" ON boat_service_flags
FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

**Files Changed:**
- `sailorskills-billing/supabase/migrations/013_fix_integration_bugs.sql`

8. Check output for verification messages:
   ```
   NOTICE: replenishment_queue has X RLS policies
   NOTICE: boat_service_flags has X RLS policies
   NOTICE: anode_inventory has storage_location column ‚úì
   ```

### Step 3: Test Fixes

After migration completes, test each fix:

#### Test #1: Billing Modal Stock Display
1. Navigate to Billing: https://billing.sailorskills.com
2. Log in: standardhuman@gmail.com / KLRss!650
3. Open a service with multiple anode statuses
4. Click "Review Inventory Actions"
5. **Verify:** Stock shows `(X in stock, Y available)` format
6. **Verify:** Order section shows actual stock, not "(out of stock)"

#### Test #2: Replenishment Queue
1. Navigate to Inventory: https://sailorskills-inventory-kqes0q8hl-brians-projects-bc2d3592.vercel.app
2. Click "Orders" tab
3. **Verify:** Replenishment Queue section loads (no "Error loading data")
4. **Expected:** May show empty state if no pending orders
5. **Create test order** from Billing with "order" status anode
6. **Verify:** Item appears in queue
7. **Test actions:** Mark Ordered ‚Üí Mark Received
8. **Verify:** Status updates and inventory increments

#### Test #3: Operations Packing List
1. Navigate to Operations: https://ops.sailorskills.com
2. Log in: standardhuman@gmail.com / KLRss!650
3. Click "Packing Lists" tab
4. **Verify:** Monthly view loads (no "Error loading packing list")
5. **Expected:** Shows boats scheduled this month
6. **Verify:** "Anodes to Retrieve" section appears
7. **Create test retrieval** from Billing with "retrieve" status
8. **Verify:** Item appears in packing list with storage location

### Code Changes
- **1 file modified:** `src/admin/inventory-review-modal.js`
  - Stock display logic improved
  - Shows both on_hand and available quantities
  - "Order" section now queries inventory

### Database Changes
- **1 migration added:** `013_fix_integration_bugs.sql`

## üß™ End-to-End Test Scenario

After deploying, test the complete integration flow:

### Scenario: Process Service with All 3 Anode Statuses

1. **Setup:** Boat with 3 anodes needing different actions
   - Anode A: Needs replacement (replaced)
   - Anode B: In storage, retrieve for next service (retrieve)
   - Anode C: Out of stock, need to order (order)

2. **Billing:** Create service and assign statuses
   - Open service for boat
   - Assign anode statuses
   - Click "Review Inventory Actions"
   - **Verify modal shows:**
     - Stock counts correct
     - Retrieve anodes show `(X in stock, Y available)`
     - Order anodes show `(X in stock - need to order more)`
   - Click "Confirm & Finalize Service"

3. **Database:** Verify records created
   - `inventory_transactions`: 1 record (consumption for replaced)
   - `anode_inventory`: quantity_allocated increased for retrieve
   - `replenishment_queue`: 1 record (for order)
   - `boat_service_flags`: 2 records (1 retrieve, 1 order)

4. **Inventory Orders:** View and manage
   - Navigate to Inventory ‚Üí Orders
   - **Verify:** Replenishment Queue shows order
   - Click "Mark Ordered"
   - **Verify:** Status changes to 'ordered'
   - Click "Mark Received"
   - **Verify:** Status ‚Üí 'received', inventory incremented

5. **Operations Packing:** View retrieval tasks
   - Navigate to Operations ‚Üí Packing Lists
   - **Verify:** Monthly view shows retrieval task
   - **Verify:** Shows storage location and bin number
   - **Verify:** Boat appears in "Anodes to Retrieve" section

6. **Final Verification:**
   - All 3 data flows working
   - Stock levels accurate
   - No errors in any UI

## üìù Migration Verification

After running the migration, verify with these SQL queries:

```sql
-- Check RLS enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('replenishment_queue', 'boat_service_flags');
-- Both should show: rowsecurity = TRUE

-- Check RLS policies exist
SELECT tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('replenishment_queue', 'boat_service_flags');
-- Should show multiple policies for each table

-- Check storage_location column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'anode_inventory'
AND column_name IN ('primary_location', 'storage_location');
-- Should show both columns

-- Test query as anon user
SET ROLE anon;
SELECT * FROM replenishment_queue LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM boat_service_flags LIMIT 1;
-- Both queries should succeed (not "permission denied")
```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Integration is fully working when:

‚úÖ Billing modal shows accurate stock counts
‚úÖ Inventory Orders loads replenishment queue without errors
‚úÖ Operations Packing Lists loads without errors
‚úÖ Can complete full workflow: Billing ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Inventory ‚Üí Operations
‚úÖ Inventory increments when marking items as received
‚úÖ Packing lists show retrieval tasks with storage locations
‚úÖ All 3 services can read/write their respective tables

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur after migration:

1. **Disable RLS temporarily:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE replenishment_queue DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE boat_service_flags DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Revert code changes:**
   ```bash
   cd sailorskills-billing
   git revert ae09c6a
   git push
   ```

3. **Investigate and fix issues**

4. **Re-enable RLS with corrected policies**
