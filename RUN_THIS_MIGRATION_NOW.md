# üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Run Database Migration

## Why You're Seeing Errors

The console errors you're seeing are because the database migration **hasn't been run yet**:

```
400 errors on:
- /rest/v1/service_orders (Operations Packing Lists)
- /rest/v1/replenishment_queue (Inventory Orders)
- /rest/v1/boat_service_flags (Operations Packing Lists)
```

**Root cause:** These tables have no RLS (Row Level Security) policies, so your apps (using anon key) are blocked from reading them.

## üêõ What This Migration Fixes

### Fix #1: service_orders RLS
**Symptom:** Operations Packing Lists showing "Error loading packing list"
**Cause:** Table had no RLS policies
**Fix:** Added public SELECT policy

### Fix #2: replenishment_queue RLS
**Symptom:** Inventory Orders showing "Error loading data"
**Cause:** Table had no RLS policies
**Fix:** Added public SELECT + UPDATE policies

### Fix #3: boat_service_flags RLS
**Symptom:** Operations Packing Lists 400 errors
**Cause:** Table had no RLS policies
**Fix:** Added public SELECT policy

### Fix #4: storage_location column
**Symptom:** (Potential future issue)
**Fix:** Ensures column exists for queries

## üìã Quick Verification Queries

After running the migration, test with these SQL queries in Supabase:

```sql
-- Set to anon role (simulates your app)
SET ROLE anon;

-- These should all succeed (not "permission denied")
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM replenishment_queue;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM boat_service_flags;

-- Reset role
RESET ROLE;
```

If any of these fail with "permission denied", the migration didn't work correctly.

---

## üî• Troubleshooting

### If migration fails:

1. **Check error message** - Most common: table doesn't exist yet
2. **Run COMPLETE-SETUP.sql first** - Creates missing tables
3. **Try migration again**

### If still seeing 400 errors after migration:

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Check Supabase logs** in dashboard
4. **Verify policies were created:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename IN ('service_orders', 'replenishment_queue', 'boat_service_flags');
   ```

---

## üéâ Success!

Once the migration runs successfully:

‚úÖ Operations Packing Lists will load
‚úÖ Inventory Orders will load
‚úÖ Billing modal will show correct stock
‚úÖ Full integration workflow will work

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes
**Risk:** Very low (only adding read permissions)
**Reversible:** Yes (can disable RLS if needed)
