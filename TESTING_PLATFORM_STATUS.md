## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Develop Features with Confidence ✅

```bash
# Write feature code
# Write Playwright tests
# Commit (pre-commit hooks validate automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature-branch

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Detects which services changed
# - Waits for Vercel preview deployment
# - Runs Playwright tests against preview
# - Validates visual regression
# - Checks database schema
# - Reports results in PR

# Merge when all checks pass
# Production deployment triggers smoke tests
```

### 2. Run Tests Locally ✅

```bash
cd sailorskills-portal

# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run visual regression tests
npx playwright test --grep @visual

# Run with browser visible
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Update visual baselines
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

### 3. Validate Database Changes ✅

```bash
# Test migration before applying
node scripts/apply-migration-dry-run.mjs supabase/migrations/migration.sql

# Validate schema matches expected
node scripts/validate-schema.mjs

# Test RLS policies
node scripts/test-rls-policies.mjs

# Create test data
node scripts/create-test-data.mjs

# Clean up test data
TEST_SCENARIO_ID=my-test node scripts/cleanup-test-data.mjs
```

### 4. Expand Testing to Other Services ✅

```bash
cd sailorskills-[service]

# Copy setup from portal
cp ../sailorskills-portal/playwright.config.js ./
cp -r ../sailorskills-portal/tests ./

# Install dependencies
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test husky lint-staged prettier

# Set up pre-commit hooks
npx husky install
cp ../sailorskills-portal/.husky/pre-commit .husky/

# Update package.json with lint-staged config
# (Copy from portal's package.json)

# Write service-specific tests
# Done! ✅
```
